#ANNE.
Louis, it is growing dark very fast.
#LOUIS.
I had not observed it, my sister.
#ANNE.
People are still crowding in front of the wine - shop across the street.
#LOUIS.
Naturally. Reading the list of the proscribed that came at noon. Also waiting, amiable vultures, for the next bulletin from Paris. It will give the names of those guillotined day before yesterday. For a good bet: our own names - yes, hers, too - are all three in the former. As for the latter - well, they can't get us in that now.
#ANNE.
Then you are certain that we are safe?
#LOUIS.
I am certain only that they cannot murder us day before yesterday.
#ELOISE.
Is he still there?
#ANNE.
I lost sight of him in the crowd. I think he has gone. If only he does not come back!
#LOUIS.
He will.
#ANNE.
I am trying to hope not.
#ELOISE.
I have told you from the first that you overestimate his importance. Haven't I said it often enough?
#ANNE.
You have!
#ELOISE.
He will not harm you.
#ANNE.
More people down there; they are running to the wine - shop.
#LOUIS.
Gentle idlers! That means that the list of the guillotined has arrived from Paris.
#ANNE.
They are posting it in the wine - shop window.
#LOUIS.
Ah! One remarks that the list is a long one. The good people are well satisfied with it. My cousin, in this amiable populace which you champion, do you never scent something of - well, something of the graveyard scavenger?
#ANNE.
Haven't you finished, Louis?
#LOUIS.
A dozen.
#ANNE.
Not good enough?
#LOUIS.
I have lived to discover that among all the disadvantages of being a Peer of France the most dangerous is that one is so poor a forger. Truly, however, our parents are not to be blamed for neglecting to have me instructed in this art; evidently they perceived I had no talent for it. Oh, vile! I am not even an amateur. Do you suppose the Fates took all the trouble to make the Revolution simply to teach me that I have no skill in forgery? Listen. "Committee of Public Safety. In the name of the Republic. To all Officers, Civil and Military: Permit the Citizen Balsage" - that's myself, remember - "and the Citizeness Virginie Balsage, his sister" - that's you, Anne - "and the Citizeness Marie Balsage, his second sister" - that is Eloise, you understand - "to embark in the vessel Jeune Pierrette from the port of Boulogne for Barcelona. Signed: Billaud Varennes. Carnot. Robespierre." Execrable! I am not even sure it is the proper form. Ah, that Dossonville!
#ANNE.
But Dossonville helped us -
#LOUIS.
At a price. Dossonville! An individual of marked attainment, not only in penmanship, but in the art of plausibility. Before I paid him he swore that the passports he forged for us would take us not only out of Paris, but out of the country.
#ANNE.
Are you sure we must have a separate permit to embark?
#LOUIS.
The captain of the Jeune Pierrette sent one of his sailors to tell me. There is a new Commissioner from the National Committee, he said, and a special order was issued this morning. They have an officer and a file of the National Guard on the quay to see that the order is obeyed.
#ANNE.
But we bought passports in Paris. Why can't we here?
#LOUIS.
Send out a street - crier for an accomplished forger? My poor Anne! We can only hope that the lieutenant on the quay may be drunk when he examines my dreadful "permit." Pray a great thirst upon him, my sister! Four o'clock. At five the tide in the river is poised at its highest; then it must run out, and the Jeune Pierrette with it. We have an hour. I return to my crime.
#ANNE.
Hurry, Louis!
#LOUIS.
Watch for Master Spy.
#ANNE.
I cannot see him.
#LOUIS.
Still you don't see him?
#ANNE.
No. The people are dispersing. They seem in a good humor.
#LOUIS.
Ah, if they knew - I suppose I have the distinction to be one of the most hated men in our country, now that all the decent people have left it - so many by a road something of the shortest! Yes, these merry gentlemen below there would be still merrier if they knew they had within their reach a forfeited "Emigrant." I wonder how long it would take them to climb the breakneck flights to our door. Lord, there'd be a race for it! Prize - money, too, I fancy, for the first with his bludgeon.
#ANNE.
Louis, Louis! Why didn't you lie safe in England?
#LOUIS.
Anne, Anne! I had to come back for a good sister of mine.
#ANNE.
But I could have escaped alone.
#LOUIS.
That is it - "alone"! For she would not have moved at all if I hadn't come to bully her into it. A fanatic, a fanatic!
#ANNE.
She is a fool. Therefore be patient with her.
#LOUIS.
Hush.
#ELOISE.
Oh, I heard you! What does it matter? There! I've finished your packing for you.
#LOUIS.
My cousin, I regret that we could not provide servants for this flight. I regret that we have been compelled to ask you to do a share of what is necessary.
#ELOISE.
That all?
#LOUIS.
I fear -
#ELOISE.
Yes, you usually do. What now?
#LOUIS.
The portmanteau is too heavy.
#ELOISE.
You mean you're too weak to carry it?
#LOUIS.
Suppose at the last moment it becomes necessary to hasten exceedingly -
#ELOISE.
You mean, suppose you had to run, you'd throw away the portmanteau. Oh, I don't doubt you'd do it!
#LOUIS.
I dislike to leave my baggage upon the field, but in case of a rout it might be a temptation - if it were an impediment.
#ANNE.
Don't waste time. Lighten the portmanteau.
#LOUIS.
You may take out everything of mine.
#ELOISE.
There's nothing of yours in it except your cloak. You don't suppose -
#ANNE.
Take out that heavy brocade of mine.
#ELOISE.
Thank you for not wishing to take out my fur - lined cloak and freezing me at sea!
#LOUIS.
Take out both the cloak and the dress.
#ELOISE.
What!
#LOUIS.
You shall have mine. It is as warm, but not so heavy.
#ELOISE.
Oh, I am sick of your eternal packing and unpacking! I am sick of it!
#ANNE.
Watch at the window, then. I think it will be light enough now, Louis.
#LOUIS.
Do not leave those things in sight. If our landlord should come in -
#ANNE.
I'll hide them in the bed in the next room. Eloise!
#ELOISE.
You find something amusing?
#LOUIS.
Myself. One of my mistakes, that is all.
#ELOISE.
Your mirth must be indefatigable if you can still laugh at those.
#LOUIS.
I agree. I am a history of error.
#ELOISE.
You should have made it a vocation; it is your one genius. And yet - truly because I am a fool I think, as Anne says - I let you hector me into a sillier mistake than any of yours.
#LOUIS.
When?
#ELOISE.
Oh, when I consented to this absurd journey, this tiresome journey - with you! An "escape"? From nothing. In "disguise." Which doesn't disguise.
#LOUIS.
My sister asked me to be patient with you, Eloise -
#ELOISE.
Because I am a fool, yes. Thanks. And then, my worthy young man?
#LOUIS.
Have I not been patient with you?
#ELOISE.
If I have asked you to be anything whatever - with me! - pray recall the petition to my memory.
#LOUIS.
Patient! Have I ever been anything but patient with you? Was I not patient with you five years ago when you first harangued us on your "Rights of Man" and your monstrous republicanism? Where you got hold of it all I don't know -
#ELOISE.
Ideas, my friend. Naturally, incomprehensible to you. Books! Brains! Men!
#LOUIS.
"Books! Brains! Men!" Treason, poison, and mobs! Oh, I could laugh at you then: they were only beginning to kill us, and I was patient. Was I not patient with you when these Republicans of yours drove us from our homes, from our country, stole all we had, assassinated us in dozens, in hundreds, murdered our King? When I saw relative after relative of my own - aye, and of yours, too - dragged to the abattoir - even poor, harmless, kind André de Laseyne, whom they took simply because he was my brother - in - law - was I not patient? And when I came back to Paris for you and Anne, and had to lie hid in a stable, every hour in greater danger because you would not be persuaded to join us, was I not patient? And when you finally did consent, but protested every step of the way, pouting and -
#ELOISE.
"Pouting!"
#LOUIS.
And when that stranger came posting after us so obvious a spy -
#ELOISE.
Pooh! He is nothing.
#LOUIS.
Is there a league between here and Paris over which he has not dogged us? By diligence, on horseback, on foot, turning up at every posting - house, every roadside inn, the while you laughed at me because I read death in his face! These two days we have been here, is there an hour when you could look from that window except to see him grinning up from the wine - shop door down there?
#ELOISE.
I tell you not to fear him. There is nothing in it.
#LOUIS.
Be sure I understand why you do not think him a spy! You believe he has followed us because you -
#ELOISE.
I expected that! Oh, I knew it would come! I never saw the man before in my life!
#LOUIS.
He is unmistakable; his trade is stamped on him; a hired trailer of your precious "Nation's."
#ELOISE.
The Nation is the People. You malign because you fear. The People is sacred!
#LOUIS.
Aren't you tired yet of the Palais Royal platitudes? I have been patient with your Mericourtisms for so long. Yes, always I was patient. Always there was time; there was danger, but there was a little time. But now the Jeune Pierrette sails this hour, and if we are not out of here and on her deck when she leaves the quay, my head rolls in Samson's basket within the week, with Anne's and your own to follow! Now, I tell you, there is no more time, and now -
#ELOISE.
Yes? Well? "Now?"
#LOUIS.
I am still patient.
#ELOISE.
Is the oration concluded?
#LOUIS.
Quite.
#ELOISE.
Then "now" you'll perhaps be "patient" enough to explain why I shouldn't leave you instantly. Understand fully that I have come thus far with you and Anne solely to protect you in case you were suspected. "Now," my little man, you are safe: you have only to go on board your vessel. Why should I go with you? Why do you insist on dragging me out of the country?
#LOUIS.
Only to save your life; that is all.
#ELOISE.
My life! Tut! My life is safe with the People - my People! The Nation would protect me! I gave the people my whole fortune when they were starving. After that, who in France dare lay a finger upon the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville!
#LOUIS.
I have the idea sometimes, my cousin, that perhaps if you had not given them your property they would have taken it, anyway. They did mine.
#ELOISE.
I do not expect you to comprehend what I felt - what I feel! Oh, for a Man! - a Man who could understand me!
#LOUIS.
That excludes me!
#ELOISE.
Shall I spell it?
#LOUIS.
You are right. So far from understanding you, I understand nothing. The age is too modern for me. I do not understand why this rabble is permitted to rule France; I do not even understand why it is permitted to live.
#ELOISE.
Because you belong to the class that thought itself made of porcelain and the rest of the world clay. It is simple: the mud - ball breaks the vase.
#LOUIS.
You belong to the same class, even to the same family.
#ELOISE.
You are wrong. One circumstance proves me no aristocrat.
#LOUIS.
What circumstance?
#ELOISE.
That I happened to be born with brains. I can account for it only by supposing some hushed - up ancestral scandal. Do you understand that?
#LOUIS.
I overlook it.
#ELOISE.
Quibbling was always a habit of yours. Oh, stop that writing! You can't do it, and you don't need it. You blame the people because they turn on you now, after you've whipped and beaten and ground them underfoot for centuries and centuries and -
#LOUIS.
Quite a career for a man of twenty - nine!
#ELOISE.
I have said that quibbling was -
#LOUIS.
Perhaps it is. To return to my other deficiencies, I do not understand why this spy who followed us from Paris has not arrested me long before now. I do not understand why you hate me. I do not understand the world in general. And in particular I do not understand the art of forgery.
#ELOISE.
You talk of "patience"! How often have I explained that you would not need passports of any kind if you would let me throw off my incognito. If anyone questions you, it will be sufficient if I give my name. All France knows the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville. Do you suppose the officer on the quay would dare oppose -
#LOUIS.
I know you think it.
#ELOISE.
You tempt me not to prove it. But for Anne's sake -
#LOUIS.
Not for mine. That, at least, I understand. My dear cousin, I am going to be very serious -
#ELOISE.
O heaven!
#LOUIS.
I shall not make another oration -
#ELOISE.
Make anything you choose. What does it matter?
#LOUIS.
I have a presentiment - I ask you to listen -
#ELOISE.
How can I help but listen? And Anne, too! You know as well as I do that when that door is open everything you say in this room is heard in there.
#ELOISE.
Forward, soldiers!
#LOUIS.
Eloise!
#ELOISE.
Well, open the door, then, if you want her to hear you make love to me! That's what you're going to do, isn't it?
#LOUIS.
I wish to ask you for the last time -
#ELOISE.
There are so many last times!
#LOUIS.
To ask you if you are sure that you know your own heart. You cared for me once, and -
#ELOISE.
I did? Who under heaven ever told you that?
#LOUIS.
You allowed yourself to be betrothed to me, I believe.
#ELOISE.
"Allowed" is the word, precisely. I seem to recall changing all that the very day I became an orphan - and my own master! Pray correct me if my memory errs. How long ago was it? Six years? Seven?
#LOUIS.
Eloise, Eloise, you did love me then! We were happy, both of us, so very happy -
#ELOISE.
"Both!" My faith! But I must have been a brave little actress.
#LOUIS.
I do not believe it. You loved me. I -
#ELOISE.
Do get on with what you have to say.
#LOUIS.
I have many forebodings, Eloise, but the strongest - and for me the saddest - is that this is the last chance you will ever have to tell - to tell me -
#ELOISE.
To tell you what?
#LOUIS.
That your love for me still lingers.
#ELOISE.
Well, it doesn't. So that's over!
#LOUIS.
Not quite yet. I -
#ELOISE.
O Death!
#LOUIS.
Listen. I have hope that you and Anne may be permitted to escape; but as for me, since the first moment I felt the eyes of that spy from Paris upon me I have had the premonition that I would be taken back - to the guillotine, Eloise. I am sure that he will arrest me when I attempt to leave this place to - night. And it is with the certainty in my soul that this is our last hour together that I ask you if you cannot tell me that the old love has come back. Is there nothing in your heart for me?
#ELOISE.
Was there anything in your heart for the beggar who stood at your door in the old days?
#LOUIS.
Is there nothing for him who stands at yours now, begging for a word?
#ELOISE.
I remember you had the name of a disciplinarian in your regiment. Did you ever find anything in your heart for the soldiers you ordered tied up and flogged? Was there anything in your heart for the peasants who starved in your fields?
#LOUIS.
No; it was too full of you.
#ELOISE.
Words! Pretty little words!
#LOUIS.
Thoughts. Pretty, because they are of you. All, always of you - always, my dear. I never really think of anything but you. The picture of you is always before the eyes of my soul; the very name of you is forever in my heart. And it is on the tips of my fingers, sometimes when it shouldn't be. See. This is what I laughed at a while ago. I tried to write, with you near me, and unconsciously I let your name creep into my very forgery! I wrote it as I wrote it in the sand when we were children; as I have traced it a thousand times on coated mirrors - on frosted windows. "Permit the Citizen Balsage and his sister, the Citizeness Virginie Balsage, and his second sister, the Citizeness Marie Balsage, and Eloise d'Anville" - so I wrote! - "to embark upon the vessel Jeune Pierrette - " You see? Even in this danger, that I feel closer and closer with every passing second, your name came in of itself. I am like that English Mary: if they will open my heart when I am dead, they shall find, not "Calais," but "Eloise"!
#ELOISE.
Louis, that doesn't interest me.
#LOUIS.
I told you long ago -
#ELOISE.
So you did - often!
#LOUIS.
I have nothing new to offer. I understand. I bore you.
#ELOISE.
Louis, to be frank: I don't care what they find in your heart when they open it.
#LOUIS.
Have you never reflected that there might be something for me to forgive you?
#ELOISE.
What!
#LOUIS.
I wonder sometimes if you have ever found a flaw in your own character.
#ELOISE.
So! You are assuming the right to criticize me, are you? Oho!
#LOUIS.
I state merely - I have said - I think I forgive you a great deal -
#ELOISE.
You do! You bestow your gracious pardon upon me, do you? Keep your forgiveness to yourself! When I want it I'll kneel at your feet and beg it of you! You can kiss me then, for then you will know that "the old love has come back"!
#LOUIS.
When you kneel -
#ELOISE.
Can you picture it - Marquis? I am a woman of the Republic!
#LOUIS.
And the Republic has no need of love.
#ELOISE.
Its daughter has no need of yours!
#LOUIS.
Until you kneel to me. You have spoken. It is ended. My cousin, suffer the final petition of a bore. Forgive my seriousness; forgive my stupidity, for I believe that what one hears now means that a number of things are indeed ended. Myself among them.
#ELOISE.
"What one hears?"
#LOUIS.
In the distance.
#ELOISE.
What is it?
#LOUIS.
Only a song!
#ANNE.
I have hidden the cloak and the dress beneath the mattress. Have you -
#LOUIS.
Listen!
#ANNE.
The "Marseillaise"!
#LOUIS.
The "Vultures' Chorus"!
#ELOISE.
The Hymn of Liberty!
#ANNE.
It grows louder.
#LOUIS.
Nearer!
#ELOISE.
They are coming this way!
#ANNE.
They have turned the corner of the street. Keep back, Louis!
#ELOISE.
Vive la - mob - carrying torches and dancing. They are following a troop of soldiers.
#LOUIS.
The National Guard.
#ANNE.
Keep back from the window! A man in a tricolor scarf marching in front. political, then - an official of their government.
#ANNE.
O Virgin, have mercy! It is that -
#LOUIS.
Of course. Our spy.
#ANNE.
Lights! Light those candles in the sconce, Eloise! Light all the candles we have.
#LOUIS.
No, no! Put them out!
#ANNE.
Oh, fatal! If our window is lighted he will believe we have no thought of leaving, and pass by.
#LOUIS.
He will not pass by.
#ELOISE.
You are disturbing yourselves without reason. They will not stop here.
#ANNE.
They have stopped.
#LOUIS.
At the door of this house?
#ANNE.
He is in the house. The soldiers followed him.
#LOUIS.
They are on the lower stairs. My sister and my cousin, my poor plans have only made everything worse for you. I cannot ask you to forgive me. We are caught.
#ANNE.
Not till the very last shred of hope is gone. Is that door fastened?
#LOUIS.
They'll break it down, of course.
#ANNE.
Where is our passport from Paris?
#LOUIS.
Here.
#ANNE.
Quick! Which of these "permits" is the best?
#LOUIS.
They're all hopeless -
#ANNE.
Any of them. We can't stop to select.
#ELOISE.
All this is childish. I shall merely announce -
#ANNE.
You'll announce nothing! Out of here, both of you!
#LOUIS.
No, no!
#ANNE.
Let them break the door in if they will; only let them find me alone. Give me the chance to make them think I am here alone.
#LOUIS.
I can't -
#ANNE.
Is there any other possible hope for us? Is there any other possible way to gain even a little time? Louis, I want your word of honor not to leave that room unless I summon you. I must have it!
#ELOISE.
You needn't think I shall consent to hide myself. I shall tell them -
#ANNE.
You will not ruin us! In there, I tell you!
#ANNE.
Who is - there?
#A SONOROUS VOICE.
French Republic!
#ANNE.
, It is - it is difficult to hear. What do you -
#VALSIN.
Open the door.
#ANNE.
That is impossible.
#VALSIN.
Open the door.
#ANNE.
What is your name?
#VALSIN.
Valsin, National Agent.
#ANNE.
I do not know you.
#VALSIN.
Open!
#ANNE.
I am here alone. I am dressing. I can admit no one.
#VALSIN.
For the last time: open!
#ANNE.
No!
#VALSIN.
Break it down.
#ANNE.
No, no, no! You shall not come in! I tell you I have not finished dressing. If you are men of honor - Ah!
#VALSIN.
Permit me. Be gracious to a recent fellow - traveler. I introduce myself. At your service: Valsin, Agent of the National Committee of Public Safety. Soldiers! To the street door. I will conduct the examination alone. My assistant will wait on this floor, at the top of the stair. Send the people away down below there, officer. Look to the courtyard. Clear the streets.
#ANNE.
How dare you break down my door! How dare you force your -
#VALSIN.
My compliments on the celerity with which the citizeness has completed her toilet. Marvelous. An example to her sex.
#ANNE.
You intend robbery, I suppose.
#VALSIN.
Not precisely.
#ANNE.
What, then?
#VALSIN.
I have come principally for the returned Emigrant, Louis Valny - Cherault, formerly called Marquis de Valny - Cherault, formerly of the former regiment of Valny; also formerly -
#ANNE.
I do not know what you mean by all these names - and "formerlies"!
#VALSIN.
No? Citizeness, pray assert that I did not encounter you last week on your journey from Paris -
#ANNE.
It is true I have been to Paris on business; you may have seen me - I do not know. Is it a crime to return from Paris?
#VALSIN.
It will amuse me to hear you declare that I did not see you traveling in company with Louis Valny - Cherault. Come! Say it.
#ANNE.
I am alone, I tell you! I do not know what you mean. If you saw me speaking with people in the diligence, or at some posting - house, they were only traveling acquaintances. I did not know them. I am a widow -
#VALSIN.
My condolences. Poor, of course?
#ANNE.
Yes.
#VALSIN.
And lonely, of course? Loneliness is in the formula: I suggest it for fear you might forget.
#ANNE.
I am alone.
#VALSIN.
Quite right.
#ANNE.
I am a widow, I tell you - a widow, living here quietly with -
#VALSIN.
Ah - "with"! Living here alone, and also "with" - whom? Not your late husband?
#ANNE.
With my niece.
#VALSIN.
Ah! A niece! And the niece, I take it, is in your other room yonder?
#ANNE.
Yes.
#VALSIN.
Is she pretty? Ah, one must not look: the niece, likewise, has not completed her toilet.
#ANNE.
She is - asleep.
#VALSIN.
A sound napper! Why did you not say instead that she was - shaving?
#ANNE.
You shall not go in! You cannot see her! She is -
#VALSIN.
Allow me to prompt you. She is not only asleep; she is ill. She is starving. Also, I cannot go in because she is an orphan. Surely, she is an orphan? A lonely widow and her lonely orphan niece. Ah, touching - and sweet!
#ANNE.
What authority have you to force your way into my apartment and insult -
#VALSIN.
I had the honor to mention the French Republic.
#ANNE.
So! Does the French Republic persecute widows and orphans?
#VALSIN.
No. It is the making of them!
#ANNE.
Ah, horrible!
#VALSIN.
I regret that its just severity was the cause of your own bereavement, Citizeness. When your unfortunate husband, André, formerly known as the Prince de Laseyne -
#ANNE.
I tell you I do not know what you mean by these titles. My name is Balsage.
#VALSIN.
Bravo! The Widow Balsage, living here in calm obscurity with her niece. Widow Balsage, answer quickly, without stopping to think. How long have you lived here?
#ANNE.
Two months. - A year!
#VALSIN.
Good. Two months and a year! No visitors? No strangers?
#ANNE.
No.
#VALSIN.
This cap, then, belongs to your niece.
#ANNE.
It was - it was left here this afternoon by our landlord.
#VALSIN.
That is very, very puzzling.
#ANNE.
Why "puzzling"?
#VALSIN.
Because I sent him on an errand to Paris this morning. I suppose your own excursion to Paris was quite an event for you, Widow Balsage. You do not take many journeys?
#ANNE.
I am too poor.
#VALSIN.
And you have not been contemplating another departure from Boulogne?
#ANNE.
No.
#VALSIN.
Good. It is as I thought: the portmanteau is for ornament.
#ANNE.
It belongs to my niece. She came only an hour ago. She has not unpacked.
#VALSIN.
Naturally. Too ill.
#ANNE.
She had traveled all night; she was exhausted. She went to sleep at once.
#VALSIN.
Is she a somnambulist?
#ANNE.
Why?
#VALSIN.
She has just opened the door of her room in order to overhear our conversation. Observe it, Citizeness Laseyne.
#ANNE.
I do not - I - How often shall I tell you my name is Balsage!
#VALSIN.
My wretched memory. Perhaps I might remember better if I saw it written: I beg a glance at your papers. Doubtless you have your certificate of citizenship -
#ANNE.
I have papers, certainly.
#VALSIN.
The sight of them -
#ANNE.
I have my passport; you shall see. It is in proper form -
#VALSIN.
Yes, here you have your passport. And there you have others. Many of them!
#ANNE.
Old letters!
#VALSIN.
Doubtless! Oho! A permission to embark - and signed by three names of the highest celebrity. Alas, these unfortunate statesmen, Billaud Varennes, Carnot, and Robespierre! Each has lately suffered an injury to his right hand. What a misfortune for France! And what a coincidence! One has not heard the like since we closed the theatres.
#ANNE.
Give me my papers! Give me -
#VALSIN.
You see, these unlucky great men had their names signed for them by somebody else. And I should judge that this somebody else must have been writing quite recently - less than half an hour ago, from the freshness of the ink - and in considerable haste; perhaps suffering considerable anguish of mind, Widow Balsage!
#VALSIN.
Widow Balsage, if you intend no journey, why have you this forged permission to embark on the Jeune Pierrette? Widow Balsage, who is the Citizen Balsage?
#ANNE.
My brother.
#VALSIN.
Your first truth. Of course he is not in that room yonder with your niece.
#ANNE.
No, no, no; he is not! He is not here.
#VALSIN.
Poor woman! You have not even the pleasure to perceive how droll you are.
#ANNE.
I perceive that I am a fool! I also perceive that you have denounced us before the authorities here -
#VALSIN.
Pardon. In Boulogne it happens that I am the authority. I introduce myself for the third time: Valsin, Commissioner of the National Committee of Public Safety. Tallien was sent to Bordeaux; Collot to Lyons; I to Boulogne. Citizeness, were all of the august names on your permit genuine, you could no more leave this port without my counter - signature than you could take wing and fly over the Channel!
#ANNE.
You have overreached yourself! You're an ordinary spy: you followed us from Paris -
#VALSIN.
Oh, I intended you to notice that!
#ANNE.
You have claimed to be Commissioner of the highest power in France. We can prove that you are a common spy. You may go to the guillotine for that. Take care, Citizen! So! You have denounced us; we denounce you. I'll have you arrested by your own soldiers. I'll call them -
#VALSIN.
I was sure you would not force me to be premature. Remark it, Citizeness Laseyne: I am enjoying all this. I have waited a long time for it.
#ANNE.
I am the Widow Balsage, I tell you! You do not know us - you followed us from Paris. You're a spy - a hanger - on of the police. We will prove -
#VALSIN.
I left my assistant within hearing - a species of animal of mine. I may claim that he belongs to me. A worthy patriot, but skillful, who has had the honor of a slight acquaintance with you, I believe. Dossonville!
#VALSIN.
Dossonville, you may inform the Citizeness Laseyne what office I have the fortune to hold.
#DOSSONVILLE.
Bright heaven! All the world knows that you are the representative of the Committee of Public Safety. Commissioner to Boulogne.
#VALSIN.
With what authority?
#DOSSONVILLE.
Absolute - unlimited! Naturally. What else would be useful?
#VALSIN.
You recall this woman, Dossonville?
#DOSSONVILLE.
She was present when I delivered the passport to the Emigrant Valny - Cherault, in Paris.
#VALSIN.
Did you forge that passport?
#DOSSONVILLE.
No. I told the Emigrant I had. Under orders. It was genuine.
#VALSIN.
Where did you get it?
#DOSSONVILLE.
From you.
#VALSIN.
Sit down, Dossonville. Dossonville's instructions, however, did not include a "permit" to sail on the Jeune Pierrette. All of which, I confess, Citizeness, has very much the appearance of a trap!
#ANNE.
Ah - you -
#VALSIN.
Dossonville has done very well. He procured your passport, brought your "disguises," planned your journey, even gave you directions how to find these lodgings in Boulogne. Indeed, I instructed him to omit nothing for your comfort. If I am a spy, Citizeness Laseyne, at least I trust your gracious intelligence may not cling to the epithet "ordinary." My soul! but I appear to myself a most uncommon type of spy - a very intricate, complete, and unusual spy, in fact.
#ANNE.
Ah, poor Louis!
#VALSIN.
You are beginning to comprehend? That is well. Your niece's door is still ajar by the discreet width of a finger, so I assume that the Emigrant also begins to comprehend. Therefore I take my ease! You understand, my Dossonville, having long ago occupied this very apartment myself, I am serenely aware that the Emigrant can leave the other room only by the window; and as this is the fourth floor, and a proper number of bayonets in the courtyard below are arranged to receive any person active enough to descend by a rope of bed - clothes, one is confident that the said Emigrant will remain where he is. Let us make ourselves comfortable, for it is a delightful hour - an hour I have long promised myself. I am in a good humor. Let us all be happy. Citizeness Laseyne, enjoy yourself. Call me some bad names!
#ANNE.
If I could find one evil enough!
#VALSIN.
There it is: the complete incompetence of your class. You poor aristocrats, you do not even know how to swear. Your ancestors knew how! They were fighters; they knew how to swear because they knew how to attack; you poor moderns have no profanity left in you, because, poisoned by idleness, you have forgotten even how to resist. And yet you thought yourselves on top, and so you were - but as foam is on top of the wave. You forgot that power, like genius, always comes from underneath, because it is produced only by turmoil. We have had to wring the neck of your feather - head court, because while the court was the nation the nation had its pockets picked. You were at the mercy of anybody with a pinch of brains: adventurers like Mazarin, like Fouquet, like Law, or that little commoner, the woman Fish, who called herself Pompadour and took France - France, merely! - from your King, and used it to her own pleasure. Then, at last, after the swindlers had well plucked you - at last, unfortunate creatures, the People got you! Citizeness, the People had starved: be assured they will eat you to the bone - and then eat the bone! You are helpless because you have learned nothing and forgotten everything. You have forgotten everything in this world except how to be fat!
#DOSSONVILLE.
Beautiful! It is beautiful, all that! A beautiful speech!
#VALSIN.
Ass!
#DOSSONVILLE.
Perfectly, perfectly.
#VALSIN.
That wasn't a speech; it was the truth. Citizeness Laseyne, so far as you are concerned, I am the People. And I have got you. Like that! And I'm going to take you back to Paris, you and the Emigrant. I take you: you and your brother - and that rather pretty little person who traveled with you.
#ELOISE.
Leave this Jack - in - Office to me, Anne!
#DOSSONVILLE.
Lord! What glory! Oh, eyes! Oh, hair! Look at her shape! Her chin! The divine -
#VALSIN.
The lady perceives her effect, my Dossonville. It is no novelty. Sit down, my Dossonville. Let me greet one of the nieces of Widow Balsage - evidently not the sleepy one, and certainly not ill. Health so transcendent -
#ELOISE.
This is a clown, Anne. You need have no fear of him whatever. His petty authority does not extend to us.
#VALSIN.
Will the niece of Widow Balsage explain why it does not?
#ELOISE.
Because the patriot Citizeness Eloise d'Anville is here!
#VALSIN.
Yes, she is here. That "permit" yonder even mentions her by name. It is curious. I shall have to go into that. Continue, niece.
#ELOISE.
This lady is under her protection.
#VALSIN.
Pardon. Under whose protection?
#ELOISE.
Under the protection of Eloise d'Anville!
#VALSIN.
Under the pro - the protection - The protection of - Aha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho!
#ELOISE.
This man is an idiot.
#VALSIN.
Oh, pardon! It is - too - much - too much for me! You say - these people are -
#ELOISE.
Under the protection of Eloise d'Anville, imbecile! You cannot touch them. She wills it!
#ELOISE.
I was wrong: he is not an idiot.
#ANNE.
He laughs at you.
#ELOISE.
Out of bluster; because he is afraid. He is badly frightened. I know just what to do. Go into the other room with Louis.
#ANNE.
I can't hope -
#ELOISE.
You failed, didn't you?
#VALSIN.
Eloise d'Anville! This young citizeness speaks of the protection of Eloise d'Anville! Do you hear, my Dossonville? It is an ecstasy. Ecstasize, then. Scream, Dossonville!
#DOSSONVILLE.
Perfectly. Ha, ha! The citizeness is not only stirringly beautiful, she is also -
#VALSIN.
She is also a wit. Susceptible henchman, concentrate your thoughts upon domesticity. In this presence remember your wife!
#ELOISE.
Dismiss that person. I have something to say to you.
#VALSIN.
Dossonville, you are not required. We are going to be sentimental, and heaven knows you are not the moon. In fact, you are a fat old man. Exit, obesity! Go somewhere and think about your children. Flit, whale!
#DOSSONVILLE.
Perfectly, my chieftain.
#ELOISE.
Out of hearing!
#VALSIN.
The floor below.
#DOSSONVILLE.
Well understood. Perfectly, perfectly!
#VALSIN.
"Alone at last!"
#ELOISE.
Rabbit!
#VALSIN.
Repulsed at the outset! Ah, Citizeness, there were moments on the journey from Paris when I thought I detected a certain kindness in your glances at the lonely stranger.
#ELOISE.
You are to withdraw your soldiers, countersign the "permit," and allow my friends to embark at once.
#VALSIN.
Do you give it as an order, Citizeness?
#ELOISE.
I do. You will receive suitable political advancement.
#VALSIN.
You mean as a - a reward?
#ELOISE.
I guarantee that you shall receive it!
#VALSIN.
I can only beg you to spare me. You have me at your mercy.
#ELOISE.
It is well for you that you understand that!
#VALSIN.
Yes; you see I have a bad liver: it may become permanently enlarged. Laughter is my great danger.
#ELOISE.
Oh!
#VALSIN.
I have continually to remind myself that I am no longer in the first flush of youth.
#ELOISE.
Idiot! Do you not know who I am!
#VALSIN.
You? Oh yes - Oh yes, yes, I know who you are.
#ELOISE.
Then you -
#VALSIN.
As to your name, I do not say. Names at best are details; and your own is a detail that could hardly be thought to matter. What you are is obvious: you joined Louis and his sister in Paris at the barriers, and traveled with them as "Marie Balsage," a sister. You might save us a little trouble by giving us your real name; you will probably refuse, and the police will have to look it up when I take you back to Paris. Frankly, you are of no importance to us, though of course we'll send you to the Tribunal. No doubt you are a poor relative of the Valny - Cheraults, or, perhaps, you may have been a governess in the Laseyne family, or -
#ELOISE.
Idiot! Idiot!
#VALSIN.
Or the good - looking wife of some faithful retainer of the Emigrant's, perhaps.
#ELOISE.
Does the Committee of Public Safety betray the same intelligence in the appointment of all its agents? Imbecile, I -
#VALSIN.
You are of no importance, I tell you! Of course I mean politically. Otherwise, I am the first to admit extreme susceptibility. I saw that you observed it on the way - at the taverns, in the diligence, at the posting - houses, at -
#ELOISE.
Yes. I am accustomed to oglers.
#VALSIN.
Alas, I believe you! My unfortunate sex is but too responsive.
#ELOISE.
"Responsive" - Oh!
#VALSIN.
Let us return to the safer subject. Presently I shall arrest those people in the other room and, regretfully, you too. But first I pamper myself; I chat; I have an attractive woman to listen. In the matter of the arrest, I delay my fire; I do not flash in the pan, but I lengthen my fuse. Why? For the same reason that when I was a little boy and had something good to eat, I always first paid it the compliments of an epicure. I looked at it a long while. I played with it. Then - I devoured it! I am still like that. And Louis yonder is good to eat, because I happen not to love him. However, I should mention that I doubt if he could recall either myself or the circumstance which annoyed me; some episodes are sometimes so little to certain people and so significant to certain other people. Behold me, Citizeness! I am explained. I am indulging my humor: I play with my cake. Let us see into what curious little figures I can twist it.
#ELOISE.
Idiot!
#VALSIN.
I have lost count, but I think that is the sixth idiot you have called me. Aha, it is only history, which one admires for repeating itself. Good! Let us march. I shall play - I shall play with - with all four of you.
#ELOISE.
Four?
#VALSIN.
I am not easy to deceive; there are four of you here.
#ELOISE.
So?
#VALSIN.
Louis brought you and his sister from Paris: a party of three. This "permit" which he forged is for four; the original three and the woman you mentioned a while ago, Eloise d'Anville. Hence she must have joined you here. The deduction is plain: there are three people in that room: the Emigrant, his sister, and this Eloise d'Anville. To the trained mind such reasoning is simple.
#ELOISE.
Perfectly!
#VALSIN.
Nothing escapes me. You see that.
#ELOISE.
At first glance! I make you my most profound compliments. Sir, you are an eagle!
#VALSIN.
Thanks. Now, then, pretty governess, you thought this d'Anville might be able to help you. What put that in your head?
#ELOISE.
Do you pretend not to know what she is? heroine I have had the misfortune never to encounter. But I am informed of her character and history.
#ELOISE.
Then you understand that even the Agent of the National Committee risks his head if he dares touch people she chooses to protect.
#VALSIN.
Be generous to my opacity. How could she protect anybody?
#ELOISE.
She has earned the gratitude -
#VALSIN.
Of whom?
#ELOISE.
Of the Nation!
#VALSIN.
Ha, ha, ha! Pardon, oh, pardon, liver of mine. I must not die; my life is still useful.
#ELOISE.
Of the People, stupidity! Of the whole People, dolt! Of France, blockhead!
#VALSIN.
There! I am saved. Let us be solemn, my child; it is better for my malady. You are still so young that one can instruct you that individuals are rarely grateful; "the People," never. What you call "the People" means folk who are not always sure of their next meal; therefore their great political and patriotic question is the cost of food. Their heroes are the champions who are going to make it cheaper; and when these champions fail them or cease to be useful to them, then they either forget these poor champions - or eat them. Let us hear what your Eloise d'Anville has done to earn the reward of being forgotten instead of eaten.
#ELOISE.
She surrendered her property voluntarily. She gave up all she owned to the Nation.
#VALSIN.
And immediately went to live with her relatives in great luxury.
#ELOISE.
The Republic will protect her. She gave her whole estate -
#VALSIN.
And the order for its confiscation was already written when she did it.
#ELOISE.
Ah - liar!
#VALSIN.
I have seen the order. Yes, this martyr "gave" us her property; but one hears that she went to the opera just the same and wore more jewels than ever, and lived richly upon the Laseynes and Valny - Cheraults, until they were confiscated. Why, all the world knows about this woman; and let me tell you, to your credit, my governess, I think you have a charitable heart: you are the only person I ever heard speak kindly of her.
#ELOISE.
Venom!
#VALSIN.
It is with difficulty I am restraining my curiosity to see her - also to hear her! - when she learns of her proscription by a grateful Republic.
#ELOISE.
Proscribed? Eloise d'Anville proscribed? Your inventions should be more plausible, Goodman Spy! I knew you were lying -
#VALSIN.
You do not believe -
#ELOISE.
Eloise d'Anville is a known Girondist. The Gironde is the real power in France.
#VALSIN.
That party has fallen.
#ELOISE.
Not far! It will revive.
#VALSIN.
Pardon, Citizeness, but you are behind the times, and they are very fast nowadays - the times. The Gironde is dead.
#ELOISE.
It may survive you, my friend. Take care!
#VALSIN.
The Gironde had a grand façade, and that was all. It was a party composed of amateurs and orators; and of course there were some noisy camp - followers and a few comic - opera vivandières, such as this d'Anville. In short, the Gironde looked enormous because it was hollow. It was like a pie that is all crust. We have tapped the crust - with a knife, Citizeness. There is nothing left.
#ELOISE.
You say so. Nevertheless, the Rolands -
#VALSIN.
Roland was found in a field yesterday; he had killed himself. His wife was guillotined the day after you left Paris. Every one of their political friends is proscribed.
#ELOISE.
It is a lie! Not Eloise d'Anville!
#VALSIN.
Would you like to see the warrant for her arrest? Let me read you her description: "Eloise d'Anville, aristocrat. Figure, comely. Complexion, blond. Eyes, dark blue. Nose, straight. Mouth, wide - "
#ELOISE.
Let them dare! Let them dare, I say!
#VALSIN.
Dare to say her mouth is wide?
#ELOISE.
Dare to arrest her!
#VALSIN.
It does seem a pity. Yes, a great pity. She was the one amusing thing in all this somberness. She will be missed. The Revolution will lack its joke.
#ELOISE.
Ah, infamy!
#VALSIN.
Being only her friend, you speak mildly. The d'Anville herself would call it blasphemy.
#ELOISE.
She is - so vain - then?
#VALSIN.
Oh, a type - an actress.
#ELOISE.
How do you know? You said -
#VALSIN.
That I had not encountered her. One knows best the people one has never seen. Intimacy confuses judgment. I confess to that amount of hatred for the former Marquis de Valny - Cherault that I take as great an interest in all that concerns him as if I loved him. And the little d'Anville concerns him - yes, almost one would say, consumes him. The unfortunate man is said to be so blindly faithful that he can speak her name without laughing.
#ELOISE.
Oh!
#VALSIN.
No one else can do that, Citizeness. Jacobins, Cordeliers, Hébertists, even the shattered relics of the Gironde itself, all alike join in the colossal laughter at this Tricoteuse in Sèvres - this Jeanne d'Arc in rice - powder!
#ELOISE.
They laugh - and proclaim her an outlaw!
#VALSIN.
Oh, it is only that we are sweeping up the last remnants of aristocracy, and she goes with the rest - into the dust - heap. She should have remained a royalist; the final spectacle might have had dignity. As it is, she is not of her own class, not of ours: neither fish nor flesh nor - but yes, perhaps, after all, she is a fowl.
#ELOISE.
Alas! Homing - with wounded wing!
#VALSIN.
Not at all what I meant. Peacocks don't fly.
#ELOISE.
You imitation dandy! You -
#VALSIN.
My dear, your indignation for your friend is chivalrous. It is admirable; but she is not worth it. You do not understand her: you have probably seen her so much that you have never seen her as she is.
#ELOISE.
But you, august Zeus, having never seen her, will reveal her to me!
#VALSIN.
If you have ears. You see, she is not altogether unique, but of a variety known to men who are wise enough to make a study of women.
#ELOISE.
Pouff!
#VALSIN.
I profess myself an apprentice. The science itself is but in its infancy. Women themselves understand very well that they are to be classified, and they fear that we shall perceive it: they do not really wish to be known. Yet it is coming; some day our cyclopedists will have you sorted, classed, and defined with precision; but the d'Alembert of the future will not be a woman, because no woman so disloyal will ever be found. Men have to acquire loyalty to their sex: yours is an instinct. Citizen governess, I will give you a reading of the little d'Anville from this unwritten work. To begin -
#ELOISE.
Must you?
#VALSIN.
To Eloise d'Anville the most interesting thing about a rose - bush has always been that Eloise d'Anville could smell it. Moonlight becomes important when it falls upon her face; sunset is worthy when she grows rosy in it. To her mind, the universe was set in motion to be the background for a decoration, and she is the decoration. She believes that the cathedral was built for the fresco. And when a dog interests her, it is because he would look well beside her in a painting. Such dogs have no minds. I refer you to all the dogs in the portraits of Beauties.
#ELOISE.
Ah, you have heard that she is beautiful?
#VALSIN.
Far worse: that she is a Beauty. Let nothing ever tempt you, my dear, into setting up in that line. For you are very well - appearing, I assure you; and if you had been surrounded with all the disadvantages of the d'Anville, who knows but that you might have become as famous a Beauty as she? What makes a Beauty is not the sumptuous sculpture alone, but a very peculiar arrogance - not in the least arrogance of mind, my little governess. In this, your d'Anville emerged from childhood full - panoplied indeed; and the feather - head court fell headlong at her feet. It was the fated creature's ruin.
#ELOISE.
And it is because of her beauty that you drag her to the guillotine?
#VALSIN.
Bless you, I merely convey her!
#ELOISE.
Tell me, logician, was it not her beauty that inspired her to give her property to the Nation?
#VALSIN.
It was.
#ELOISE.
What perception! I am faint with admiration. And no doubt it was her beauty that made her a Republican?
#VALSIN.
What else?
#ELOISE.
Hail, oracle!
#VALSIN.
That laugh is diaphanous. I see you through it, already convinced. Ha! we may proceed. Remark this, governess: a Beauty is the living evidence of man's immortality; the one plain proof that he has a soul.
#ELOISE.
It is not so bad then, after all?
#VALSIN.
It is utterly bad. But of all people a Beauty is most conscious of her duality. Her whole life is based upon her absolute knowledge that her Self and her body are two. She sacrifices all things to her beauty because her beauty feeds her Self with a dreadful food which it has made her unable to live without.
#ELOISE.
My little gentleman, you talk like a sentimental waiter. Your metaphors are all hot from the kitchen.
#VALSIN.
It is natural; unlike your Eloise, I am really of "the People" - and starved much in my youth.
#ELOISE.
But, like her, you are still hungry. Beauty is a species of cannibal priestess, my dear. She will make burnt - offerings of her father and her mother, her sisters - her lovers - to her beauty, that it may in turn bring her the food she must have or perish.
#ELOISE.
Boum! And of course she bathes in the blood of little children?
#VALSIN.
Often.
#ELOISE.
This mysterious food -
#VALSIN.
Not at all mysterious. Sensation. There you have it. And that is why Eloise d'Anville is a renegade. You understand perfectly.
#ELOISE.
You are too polite. No.
#VALSIN.
Behold, then! Many women who are not Beauties are beautiful, but in such women you do not always discover beauty at your first glance: it is disclosed with a subtle tardiness. It does not dazzle; it is reluctant; but it grows as you look again and again. You get a little here, a little there, like glimpses of children hiding in a garden. It is shy, and sometimes closed in from you altogether, and then, unexpectedly, this belated loveliness springs into bloom before your very eyes. It retains the capacity of surprise, the vital element of charm. But the Beauty lays all waste before her at a stroke: it is soon over. Thus your Eloise, brought to court, startled Versailles; the sensation was overwhelming. Then Versailles got used to her, just as it had to its other prodigies: the fountains were there, the King was there, the d'Anville was there; and naturally, one had seen them; saw them every day - one talked of matters less accepted. That was horrible to Eloise. She had tasted; the appetite, once stirred, was insatiable. At any cost she must henceforth have always the sensation of being a sensation. She must be the pivot of a reeling world. So she went into politics. Ah, Citizeness, there was one man who understood Beauties - not Homer, who wrote of Helen! Romance is gallant by profession, and Homer lied like a poet. For the truth about the Trojan War is that the wise Ulysses made it, not because Paris stole Helen, but because the Trojans were threatening to bring her back.
#ELOISE.
Who was the man that understood Beauties?
#VALSIN.
Bluebeard.
#ELOISE.
And so Eloise d'Anville should have her head cut off?
#VALSIN.
Well, she thought she was in politics, didn't she? You may be sure she thoroughly enjoyed her hallucination that she was a great figure in the Revolution - which was cutting off the heads of so many of her relatives and old friends! Don't waste your pity, my dear.
#ELOISE.
Citizen, you must have thought a great deal about my unhappy friend. She might be flattered by so searching an interest.
#VALSIN.
Not interest in her, governess, but in the Emigrant who cools his heels on the other side of that door, greatly to my enjoyment, waiting my pleasure to arrest him. The poor wretch is the one remaining lover of this girl; faithful because he let his passion for her become a habit; and he will never get over it until he has had possession. She has made him suffer frightfully, but I shall never forgive her for not having dealt him the final stroke. It would have saved me all the bother I have been put to in avenging the injury he did me.
#ELOISE.
What "final stroke" could she have "dealt" him?
#VALSIN.
She could have loved him! I see it! I see it! Beauty's husband! What a vision! This damned, proud, loving Louis, a pomade bearer! A buttoner! An errand - boy to the perfumer's, to the chemist's, to the milliner's! A groom of the powder - closet -
#ELOISE.
How noisy you are!
#VALSIN.
You see, it is only so lately that we of "the People" have dared even to whisper. Of course, now that we are free to shout, we overdo it. We let our voices out, we let our joys out, we let our hates out. We let everything out - except our prisoners!
#ELOISE.
Do you guess what all this bluster - this tirade upon the wickedness of beauty - makes me think?
#VALSIN.
Certainly. Being a woman, you cannot imagine a bitterness which is not "personal."
#ELOISE.
"Being a woman," I think that the person who has caused you the greatest suffering in your life must be very good - looking!
#VALSIN.
Quite right. It was precisely this d'Anville. I will tell you. I was not always a politician. Six years ago I was a soldier in the Valny regiment of cavalry. That was the old army, that droll army, that royal army; so ridiculous that it was truly majestic. In the Valny regiment we had some rouge - pots for officers - and for a colonel, who but our Emigrant yonder! Aha! we suffered in the ranks, let me tell you, when Eloise had been coy; and one morning it was my turn. You may have heard that she was betrothed first to Louis and later to several others? My martyrdom occurred the day after she had announced to the court her betrothal to the young Duc de Creil, whose father afterward interfered. Louis put us on drill in a hard rain: he had the habit of relieving his chagrin like that. My horse fell, and happened to shower our commander with mud. Louis let out all his rage upon me: it was an excuse, and, naturally, he disliked mud. But I was rolling in it, with my horse: I also disliked it - and I was indiscreet enough to attempt some small reply. That finished my soldiering, Citizeness. He had me tied to a post before the barracks for the rest of the day. I remember with remarkable distinctness that the valets of heaven had neglected to warm the rain for that bath; that it was February; and that Louis's orders had left me nothing to wear upon my back except an unfulsome descriptive placard and my modesty. Altogether it was a disadvantageous position, particularly for the exchange of repartee with such of my comrades as my youthful amiability had not endeared; I have seldom seen more cheerful indifference to bad weather. Inclement skies failed to injure the spectacle: it was truly the great performance of my career; some people would not even go home to eat, and peddlers did a good trade in cakes and wine. In the evening they whipped me conscientiously - my tailor has never since made me an entirely comfortable coat. Then they gave me the place of honor at the head of a procession by torchlight and drummed me out of camp with my placard upon my back. So I adopted another profession: I had a friend who was a doctor in the stables of d'Artois; and I knew horses. He made me his assistant.
#ELOISE.
You are a veterinarian!
#VALSIN.
No; a horse - doctor. It was thus I "retired" from the army and became a politician. My friend was only a horse - doctor himself, but his name happened to be Marat.
#ELOISE.
Ah, frightful!
#VALSIN.
The sequence is simple. If Eloise d'Anville hadn't coquetted with young Creil I shouldn't be Commissioner here to - day, settling my account with Louis. I am in his debt for more than the beating: I should tell you there was a woman in my case, a slender lace - maker with dark eyes - very pretty eyes. She had furnished me with a rival, a corporal; and he brought her for a stroll in the rain past our barracks that day when I was attracting so much unsought attention. They waited for the afterpiece, enjoyed a pasty and a bottle of Beaune, and went away laughing cozily together. I did not see my pretty lace - maker again, not for years - not until a month ago. Her corporal was still with her, and it was their turn to be undesirably conspicuous. They were part of a procession passing along the Rue St. Honoré on its way to the Place of the Revolution. They were standing up in the cart; the lace - maker had grown fat, and she was scolding her poor corporal bitterly. What a habit that must have been! - they were not five minutes from the guillotine. I own that a thrill of gratitude to Louis temporarily softened me toward him, though at the very moment I was following him through the crowd. At least he saved me from the lace - maker!
#ELOISE.
You are horrible!
#VALSIN.
To my regret you must find me more and more so.
#ELOISE.
You are going to take us back to Paris, then? To the Tribunal - and to the -
#VALSIN.
I can give you no comfort, governess. You are involved with the Emigrant, and, to be frank, I am going to do as horrible things to Louis as I can invent - and I am an ingenious man. I am near the top. The cinders of Marat are in the Pantheon, but Robespierre still flames; and he claims me as his friend. I can do what I will. And I have much in store for Louis before he shall be so fortunate as to die!
#ELOISE.
And - and Eloise - d'Anville?
#VALSIN.
Yes.
#ELOISE.
You take her head because your officer punished you, six years ago, for a breach of military discipline!
#VALSIN.
Oh no. I take it, just as she injured me - incidentally. In truth, Citizeness, it isn't I who take it: I only arrest her because the government has proscribed her.
#ELOISE.
And you've just finished telling me you were preparing tortures for her! I thought you an intelligent man. Pah! You're only a gymnast.
#VALSIN.
True. I climb.
#ELOISE.
You climb alone.
#VALSIN.
Yes - alone.
#ELOISE.
Why didn't you take the lace - maker with you? You might have been happier.
#ELOISE.
You might have been happier with - a friend - to climb with you.
#VALSIN.
Citizeness - I am - I -
#ELOISE.
Yes, Say it. You are -
#VALSIN.
I have told you that I am the most susceptible of men.
#ELOISE.
Is it a crime? Come, my friend, you are a man who does climb: you will go over all. You believe in the Revolution because you have used it to lift you. But other things can help you, too. Don't you need them?
#VALSIN.
Need what?
#ELOISE.
Do I seem so useless?
#VALSIN.
Heaven help me! What do you want?
#ELOISE.
Let these people go. I have promised to save them: give them their permit to embark, and I - do not wish to leave France. My place is in Paris. You will go into the National Committee. You can be its ruler. You will rule it! I believe in you! I will go with you. I will help you! I will marry you!
#VALSIN.
Good Lord!
#ELOISE.
You are afraid -
#VALSIN.
I am! Upon my soul, I am afraid!
#ELOISE.
Of what, my friend? Tell me of what?
#VALSIN.
Of myself! I am afraid of myself because I am a prophet. This is precisely what I foretold to myself you would do! I knew it, yet I am aghast when it happens - aghast at my own cleverness!
#ELOISE.
What?
#VALSIN.
I swear I knew it, and it fits so exactly that I am afraid of myself! Aha, Valsin, you rogue! I should hate to have you on my track! Citizen governess, you are a wonderful person, but not so wonderful as this devil of a Valsin!
#ELOISE.
I cannot understand what you are talking about. Do you mean -
#VALSIN.
And what a spell was upon me! I was near calling Dossonville to preserve me.
#ELOISE.
You mean - you don't want me?
#VALSIN.
Ah, Heaven help me, I am going to laugh again! Oh, ho, ho! I am spent! Ah, ha, ha, ha! Oh, my liver, ha, ha! No, Citizeness, I do not want you! Oh, ha, ha, ha!
#ELOISE.
Oh! Swine!
#VALSIN.
Spare me! Ha, ha, ha! I am helpless! Ho, ho, ho! Citizeness, it would not be worth your while to strangle a man who is already dying!
#ELOISE.
Do you dream that I meant it?
#VALSIN.
Meant to strangle me?
#ELOISE.
To give myself to you!
#VALSIN.
In short, to - to marry me!
#ELOISE.
It was a ruse -
#VALSIN.
Yes, yes, a trick. I saw that all along.
#ELOISE.
For their sake, beast! To save them!
#VALSIN.
Of course, of course. I knew it was to save them. We'll put it like that.
#ELOISE.
It was that!
#VALSIN.
Yes, yes. I saw it from the first. It was perfectly plain. You mustn't excite yourself - nothing could have been clearer!
#ELOISE.
Poodle! Valet! Scum of the alleys! Sheep of the prisons! Jailer! Hangman! Assassin! Brigand! Horse - doctor!
#VALSIN.
Dossonville! Citizeness, I have had my great hour. I proceed with the arrests. I have given you four plenty of time to prepare yourselves. Time? Why, the Emigrant could have changed clothes with one of the women in there a dozen times if he had hoped to escape in that fashion - as historical prisoners have won clear, it is related. Fortunately, that is impossible just now; and he will not dare to attempt it.
#DOSSONVILLE.
Present, my chieftain!
#VALSIN.
Attend, Dossonville. The returned Emigrant, Valny - Cherault, is forfeited; but because I cherish a special grievance against him, I have decided upon a special punishment for him. It does not please me that he should have the comfort and ministrations of loving women on his journey to the Tribunal. No, no; the presence of his old sweetheart would make even the scaffold sweet to him. Therefore I shall take him alone. I shall let these women go.
#DOSSONVILLE.
What refinement! Admirable!
#VALSIN.
"Permit the Citizen Balsage and his sister, the Citizeness Virginie Balsage, and his second sister, Marie Balsage, and Eloise d'Anville - " Ha! You see, Dossonville, since one of these three women is here, there are two in the other room with the Emigrant. They are to come out, leaving him there. First, however, we shall disarm him. You and I have had sufficient experience in arresting aristocrats to know that they are not always so sensible as to give themselves up peaceably, and I happened to see the outline of a pistol under the Emigrant's frock the other day in the diligence. We may as well save one of us from a detestable hole through the body. Emigrant, you have heard. For your greater chagrin, these three devoted women are to desert you. Being an aristocrat, you will pretend to prefer this arrangement. They are to leave at once. Throw your pistol into this room, and I will agree not to make the arrest until they are in safety. They can reach your vessel in five minutes. When they have gone, I give you my word not to open this door for ten.
#VALSIN.
Call the lieutenant. "Permit the three women Balsage to embark without delay upon the Jeune Pierrette. Signed: Valsin." There, Citizeness, is a "permit" which permits. Come, my feminines! Your sailors await you - brave, but no judges of millinery. There's a fair wind for you; and a grand toilet is wasted at sea. Come, charmers; come!
#VALSIN.
At last! At last one beholds the regal d'Anville! No Amazon -
#DOSSONVILLE.
It looks like -
#VALSIN.
It doesn't! A cruel veil, but, oh, what queenly grace!
#VALSIN.
Oh, touching devotion! Oh, sisters! Oh, love! Oh, honey! Oh, petticoats -
#DOSSONVILLE.
The lieutenant, Citizen Commissioner.
#VALSIN.
Officer, conduct these three persons to the quay. Place them on board the Jeune Pierrette. The captain will weigh anchor instantly.
#ANNE.
Quick! In the name of -
#VALSIN.
Off with you!
#DOSSONVILLE.
We can take the Emigrant now. Why wait -
#VALSIN.
That room is empty.
#DOSSONVILLE.
What!
#VALSIN.
He's gone! Not bare - backed, but in petticoats: that's worse! He's gone, I tell you! The other was the d'Anville.
#DOSSONVILLE.
Then you recog -
#VALSIN.
Imbecile, she's as well known as the Louvre! They're off on their honeymoon! She'll take him now! She will! She will, on the soul of a prophet! Quits with you, Louis! Quits! Quits!
#DOSSONVILLE.
You've let him go! You've let 'em all go!
#VALSIN.
Well, you're not going to inform. And, also, take care of your health, friend; remember constantly that you have a weak throat, and don't you ever mention this to my wife! These are bad times, my Dossonville, and neither you nor I will see the end of them. Good Lord! Can't we have a little fun as we go along?
