#THURE.
There's some style to this room, isn't there? But then the fellow who lives here is stylish, too.
#THE WIFE.
Yes, so I understand. Of course, I've never seen your brother, but I've heard a whole lot.
#THURE.
Oh, gossip! My brother, the doctor, has gone right across Africa, and that's something everybody can't do. So it doesn't matter how many drinks he took as a young chap -
#THE WIFE.
Yes, your brother, the doctor! Who is nothing but a school - teacher, for that matter -
#THURE.
No, he's a doctor of philosophy, I tell you -
#THE WIFE.
Well, that's nothing but one who teaches. And that's just what my brother is doing in the school at Åby.
#THURE.
Your brother is all right, but he is nothing but a public - school teacher, and that's not the same as a doctor of philosophy - which isn't a boast either.
#THE WIFE.
Well, no matter what he is or what you call him, he has cost us a whole lot.
#THURE.
Of course it has been rather costly, but then he has brought us a lot of pleasure, too.
#THE WIFE.
Fine pleasures! When we've got to lose house and home for his sake!
#THURE.
That's so - but then we don't know yet if his slip - up on the loan had some kind of cause that he couldn't help. I guess it isn't so easy to send registered letters from darkest Africa.
#THE WIFE.
Whether he has any excuses or not doesn't change the matter a bit. But if he wants to do something for us - it's nothing more than he owes us.
#THURE.
Well, we'll see, we'll see! - Anyhow, have you heard they've already given him four decorations?
#THE WIFE.
Well, that doesn't help us any. I guess it'll only make him a little more stuck - up. Oh, no, it'll be some time before I get over that the sheriff had to come down on us with the papers - and bring in other people as witnesses - and then - the auction - and all the neighbours coming in and turning all we had upside down. And do you know what made me sorer than all the rest?
#THURE.
The black -
#THE WIFE.
Yes, it was that my sister - in - law should bid in my black silk dress for fifteen crowns. Think of it - fifteen crowns!
#THURE.
You just wait - just wait a little! We might get you a new silk dress -
#THE WIFE.
But it'll never be the same one - the one my sister - in - law bid in.
#THURE.
We'll get another one then! - Now, just look at that gorgeous hat over there! I guess it must be one of those royal chamberlains who's talking with Axel now.
#THE WIFE.
What do I care about that!
#THURE.
Why, don't you think it's fun that a fellow who has the same name as you and I gets to be so respected that the King's own household people have to visit him? If I remember right, you were happy for a whole fortnight when your brother, the school - teacher, had been asked to dine at the bishop's.
#THE WIFE.
I can't remember anything of the kind.
#THURE.
Of course you can't!
#THE WIFE.
But I do remember the fifteenth of March, when we had to leave our place for his sake, and we hadn't been married more than two years, and I had to carry away the child on my own arm - Oh! - and then, when the steamer came with all the passengers on board just as we had to get out - all the cocked hats in the world can't make me forget that! And, for that matter, what do you think a royal chamberlain cares about a plain gardener and his wife when they've just been turned out of house and home?
#THURE.
Look here! What do you think this is? Look at all his decorations! - Look at this one, will you!
#THE WIFE.
Oh, that silly stuff!
#THURE.
Don't you say anything against them, for you never can tell where you'll end. The gardener at Staring was made a director and a knight on the same day.
#THE WIFE.
Well, what does that help us?
#THURE.
No, of course not - it doesn't help us - but these things here may help us a whole lot in getting another place. - However, I think we've waited quite a while now, so we'd better sit down and make ourselves at home. Let me help you off with your coat - come on now!
#THE WIFE.
So you think we're going to be welcome, then? I have a feeling that our stay here won't last very long.
#THURE.
Tut, tut! And I think we're going to have a good dinner, too, if I know Axel right. If he only knew that we're here - But now you'll see! What do you want - a sandwich, perhaps? Bring us some sandwiches and beer. - Wait a moment! Get a drink for me - the real stuff, you know! You've got to take care of yourself, don't you know.
#AXEL.
At five, then - in full dress, I suppose?
#CHAMBERLAIN.
And your orders!
#AXEL.
Is it necessary?
#CHAMBERLAIN.
Absolutely necessary, if you don't want to seem rude, and that's something which you, as a democrat, want least of all. Good - bye, doctor!
#AXEL.
Good - bye.
#AXEL.
Oh, is that you, old boy? - It seems an eternity since I saw you last. And this is your wife? - Glad to see you!
#THURE.
Thanks, brother! And I wish you a happy return after your long trip.
#AXEL.
Yes, that was something of a trip - I suppose you have read about it in the papers -
#THURE.
Oh, yes, I've read all about it. And then father sent you his regards.
#AXEL.
Oh, is he still sore at me?
#THURE.
Well, you know the old man and his ways. If only you hadn't been a member of that expedition, you know, he would have thought it one of the seven wonders of the world. But as you were along, of course, it was nothing but humbug.
#AXEL.
So he's just the same as ever! Simply because I am his son, nothing I ever do can be of any value. It means he can't think very much of himself either. - Well, so much for that! And how are you getting along nowadays?
#THURE.
Not very well, exactly! There's that old loan from the bank, you know -
#AXEL.
Yes, that's right! Well, what happened to it?
#THURE.
Oh, what happened was that I had to pay it.
#AXEL.
That's too bad! But we'll settle the matter as soon as we have a chance.
#AXEL.
What's that?
#THURE.
Oh, it was only me who took the liberty of ordering a couple of sandwiches -
#AXEL.
Right you were! But I think we ought to have some wine, so I could drink the health of my sister - in - law, as I couldn't get to the wedding.
#THURE.
Oh, no - not for us! Not so early in the morning! Thanks very much!
#AXEL.
I should have asked you to stay for dinner, but I have to go out myself. Can you guess where I am going?
#THURE.
You don't mean to say you're going to the Palace?
#AXEL.
Exactly - I am asked to meet the Monarch himself.
#THURE.
Lord preserve us! - What do you think of that, Anna?
#AXEL.
I suppose the old man will turn republican after this, when he hears that His Majesty cares to associate with me.
#THURE.
See here, Axel - you'll have to pardon me for getting back to something that's not very pleasant - but it has to be settled.
#AXEL.
Is it that blessed old loan?
#THURE.
Yes, but it isn't only that. To put it plain - we've had to stand an execution for your sake, and now we're absolutely cleaned out.
#AXEL.
That's a fine state of affairs! But why in the world didn't you get the loan renewed?
#THURE.
Well, that's it! How was I to get any new sureties when you were away?
#AXEL.
Couldn't you go to my friends?
#THURE.
I did. And the result was - what it was. Can you help us out now?
#AXEL.
How am I going to help you now? Now when all my creditors are getting after me? And it won't do for me to start borrowing when they are just about to make a position for me. There's nothing that hurts you more than to borrow money. Just wait a little while, and we'll get it all straightened out.
#THURE.
If we're to wait, then everything's up with us. This is just the time to get hold of a garden - this is the time to start digging and sowing, if you are to get anything up in time. Can't you get a place for us?
#AXEL.
Where am I to get hold of a garden?
#THURE.
Among your friends.
#AXEL.
My friends keep no gardens. Now, don't you hamper me when I try to get up on firm ground! When I am there I'll pull you up, too.
#THURE.
He doesn't want to help us, Anna!
#AXEL.
I cannot - not this moment! Do you think it reasonable that I, who am seeking a job myself, should have to seek one for you, too? What would people be saying, do you think? "There, now," they would say, "we've got not only him but his relatives to look after!" And then they would drop me entirely.
#THURE.
We've got to go.
#AXEL.
Why must you go so soon?
#THURE.
We have to take the child to a doctor.
#AXEL.
For the Lord's sake, have you a child, too?
#THE WIFE.
Yes, we have. And a sick child, which lost its health when we had to move out into the kitchen so that the auction could be held.
#AXEL.
And all this for my sake! It's enough to drive me crazy! For my sake! So that I might become a famous man! - And what is there I can do for you? - Do you think it would have been better if I had stayed at home? - No, worse - for then I should have been nothing but a poor teacher, who certainly could not have been of any use to you whatever. - Listen, now! You go to the doctor, but come back here after a while. In the meantime I'll think out something.
#THURE.
Do you see now, that he wants to help us?
#THE WIFE.
Yes, but can he do it? That's the question.
#THURE.
He can do anything he wants.
#AXEL.
Don't rely too much on it - or the last state may prove worse than the first. - Oh, merciful heavens, to think that you have a sick child, too! And for my sake!
#THURE.
Oh, I guess it isn't quite as bad as it sounds.
#THE WIFE.
Yes, so you say, who don't know anything about it -
#THURE.
Well, Axel, we'll see you later then. appears in the doorway.
#THE WIFE.
Did you notice he didn't introduce us - to the chamberlain?
#THURE.
Oh, shucks, what good would that have been?
#LINDGREN.
You don't recognise me?
#AXEL.
Yes, now I do. But you have changed a great deal.
#LINDGREN.
Oh, you think so?
#AXEL.
Yes, I do, and I am surprised to find that these years can have had such an effect -
#LINDGREN.
Three years may be pretty long. - And you don't ask me to sit down?
#AXEL.
Please - but I am rather in a hurry.
#LINDGREN.
You have always been in a hurry.
#AXEL.
Why don't you say something unpleasant?
#LINDGREN.
It's coming, it's coming!
#AXEL.
How much do you need?
#LINDGREN.
Three hundred and fifty.
#AXEL.
I haven't got it, and I can't get it.
#LINDGREN.
Oh, sure! - You don't mind if I help myself to a few drops?
#AXEL.
Won't you have a glass of wine with me instead?
#LINDGREN.
No - why?
#AXEL.
Because it looks bad to be swilling whisky like that.
#LINDGREN.
How very proper you have become!
#AXEL.
Not at all, but it hurts my reputation and my credit.
#LINDGREN.
Oh, you have credit? Then you can also give me a lift, after having brought me down.
#AXEL.
That is to say: you are making demands?
#LINDGREN.
I am only reminding you that I am one of your victims.
#AXEL.
Then, because of the gratitude I owe you, I shall bring these facts back to your mind: that you helped me through the university at a time when you had plenty of money; that you helped to get my thesis printed -
#LINDGREN.
That I taught you the methods which determined your scientific career; that I, who then was as straight as anybody, exercised a favourable influence on your slovenly tendencies; that, in a word, I made you what you are; and that, finally, when I applied for an appropriation to undertake this expedition, you stepped in and took it.
#AXEL.
No, I got it. Because I, and not you, was held to be the man for the task.
#LINDGREN.
And that settled me! Thus, one shall be taken, and the other left! - Do you think that was treating me fairly?
#AXEL.
It was what the world calls "ungrateful," but the task was achieved, and by it science was enriched, the honour of our country upheld, and new regions opened for the use of coming generations.
#LINDGREN.
Here's to you! - You have had a lot of oratorical practice - But have you any idea how unpleasant it feels to play the part of one used up and cast off?
#AXEL.
I imagine it must feel very much like being conscious of ingratitude, and I can only congratulate you at not finding yourself in a position as unpleasant as my own. - But let us return to reality. What can I do for you?
#LINDGREN.
What do you think?
#AXEL.
For the moment - nothing.
#LINDGREN.
And in the next moment you are gone again. Which means that this would be the last I saw of you.
#AXEL.
Will you do me the favour of not finishing the bottle? I don't want the servants to suspect me of it.
#LINDGREN.
Oh, go to hell!
#AXEL.
You don't think it's pleasant for me to have to call you down like this, do you?
#LINDGREN.
Say - do you want to get me a ticket for the banquet to - night?
#AXEL.
I am sorry to say that I don't think you would be admitted.
#LINDGREN.
Because -
#AXEL.
You are drunk!
#LINDGREN.
Thanks, old man! - Well, will you let me have a look at your botanical specimens, then?
#AXEL.
No, I am going to describe them myself for the Academy.
#LINDGREN.
How about your ethnographical stuff?
#AXEL.
No, that's not my own.
#LINDGREN.
Will you - let me have twenty - five crowns?
#AXEL.
As I haven't more than twenty myself, I can only give you ten.
#LINDGREN.
Rotten!
#AXEL.
Thus stand the affairs of the man everybody envies. Do you think there is anybody in whose company I might feel happy? Not one! Those that are still down hate me for climbing up, and those already up fear one coming from below.
#LINDGREN.
Yes, you are very unfortunate!
#AXEL.
I am! And I can tell you that after my experience during the last half - hour, I wouldn't mind changing place with you. What a peaceful, unassailable position he holds who has nothing to lose! What a lot of interest and sympathy those that are obscure and misunderstood and over - looked always arouse! You have only to hold out your hand and you get a coin. You have only to open your arms, and there are friends ready to fall into them. And then what a powerful party behind you - formed of the millions who are just like you! You enviable man who don't realise your own good fortune!
#LINDGREN.
So you think me that far down, and yourself as high up as all that? - Tell me, you don't happen to have read to - day's paper?
#AXEL.
No, and I don't care to read it either.
#LINDGREN.
But you ought to do it for your own sake.
#AXEL.
No, I am not going to do it - not even for your sake. It is as if you said: "Come here and let me spit at you." And then you are silly enough to demand that I shall come, too. - Do you know, during these last minutes I have become more and more convinced that if I had ever come across you in the jungle, I should beyond all doubt have picked you off with my breech - loader?
#LINDGREN.
I believe it - beast of prey that you are!
#AXEL.
It isn't safe to settle accounts with one's friends, or with persons with whom one has been intimate, for it is hard to tell in advance who has most on the debit side. But as you are bringing in a bill, I am forced to look it over. - You don't think it took me long to discover that back of all your generosity lay an unconscious desire to turn me into the strong arm which you lacked - to make me do for you what you couldn't do for yourself? I had imagination and initiative - you had nothing but money and - "pull." So I am to be congratulated that you didn't eat me, and I may be excused for eating you - my only choice being to eat or be eaten!
#LINDGREN.
You beast of prey!
#AXEL.
You rodent, who couldn't become a beast of prey - although that was just what you wished! And what you want at this moment is not so much to rise up to me as to pull me down to where you are. - If you have anything of importance to add, you had better hurry up, for I am expecting a visit.
#LINDGREN.
From your fiancée?
#AXEL.
So you have snooped that out, too?
#LINDGREN.
Sure enough! And I know what Marie, the deserted one, thinks and says - I know what has happened to your brother and his wife -
#AXEL.
Oh, you know my fiancée? For, you see, it so happens that I am not yet engaged!
#LINDGREN.
No, but I know her fiancé.
#AXEL.
What does that mean?
#LINDGREN.
Why, she has been running around with another fellow all the time - So you didn't know that?
#AXEL.
Oh, yes, I knew of it, but I thought she was done with him - See here, if you'll come back in a quarter of an hour, I'll try to get things arranged for you in some way or another.
#LINDGREN.
Is that a polite way of showing me the door?
#AXEL.
No, it's an attempt to meet an old obligation. Seriously!
#LINDGREN.
Well, then I'll go - and come back - Good - bye for a while.
#WAITER.
There's a gentleman here who wants to see you.
#AXEL.
Let him come in.
#LINDGREN.
Well, good - bye. AXEL - and good luck!
#AXEL.
Good - bye.
#AXEL.
With whom have I the honour - ?
#FIANCÉ.
My name is not a name in the same way as yours, Doctor, and my errand concerns a matter of the heart -
#AXEL.
Oh, do you happen to be - You know Miss Cecilia?
#FIANCÉ.
I am the man.
#AXEL.
Please be seated.
#AXEL.
Have my bill made out, see that my trunk is packed, and bring me a carriage in half an hour.
#WAITER.
Yes, Doctor.
#AXEL.
Now let's hear what you have to say?
#FIANCÉ.
There were two men living in the same city, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had sheep and cattle in plenty. The poor man owned nothing but one ewe lamb -
#AXEL.
What does that concern me?
#FIANCÉ.
One ewe lamb, which he had bought and was trying to raise.
#AXEL.
Oh, life's too short. What do you want? Are you and Miss Cecilia still engaged?
#FIANCÉ.
I haven't said a word about Miss Cecilia, have I?
#AXEL.
Well, sir, you had better get down to business, or I'll show you the door. But be quick about it, and get straight to the point, without any frills -
#FIANCÉ.
May I?
#AXEL.
No, thanks. great man like you has no such little weaknesses, I suppose?
#AXEL.
As you don't seem willing to speak, I shall. Of course, it is none of your business, but it may do you good to learn of it, as you don't seem to know it: I am regularly engaged to Miss Cecilia, who formerly was your fiancée.
#FIANCÉ.
Who was?
#AXEL.
Because she has broken with you.
#FIANCÉ.
I know nothing about it.
#AXEL.
That's strange, but now you do know. And here you can see the ring she has given me.
#FIANCÉ.
So she has broken with me?
#AXEL.
Yes, as she couldn't be engaged to two men at the same time, and as she had ceased to care for you, she had to break with you. I might have told you all this in a more decent fashion, if you hadn't stepped on my corns the moment you came in.
#FIANCÉ.
I didn't do anything of the kind.
#AXEL.
Cowardly and disingenuous - cringing and arrogant at the same time!
#FIANCÉ.
You are a hard man, Doctor.
#AXEL.
No, but I may become one. You showed no consideration for my feelings a moment ago. You sneered, which I didn't. And that's the end of our conversation.
#FIANCÉ.
I feared that you might take away from me my only lamb - but you wouldn't do that, you who have so many -
#AXEL.
Suppose I wouldn't - are you sure she would stay with you anyhow?
#FIANCÉ.
Put yourself in my place, Doctor -
#AXEL.
Yes, if you'll put yourself in mine.
#FIANCÉ.
I am a poor man -
#AXEL.
So am I! But judging by what I see and hear, you have certain bliss waiting for you in the beyond. That's more than I have. - And, furthermore, I have taken nothing away from you: I have only received what was offered me. Just as you did!
#FIANCÉ.
And I who had been dreaming of a future for this young woman - a future full of brightness -
#AXEL.
Pardon me a piece of rudeness, but you began it: are you so sure that the future of this young woman will not turn out a great deal brighter by my side?
#FIANCÉ.
You are now reminding me of my humble position as a worker -
#AXEL.
No, I am reminding you of that young woman's future, which you have so much at heart. And as I am told that she has ceased to care for you, but does care for me, I am only taking the liberty to dream of a brighter future for her with the man she loves than with the man she doesn't love.
#FIANCÉ.
You are a strong man, you are, and we little ones were born to be your victims!
#AXEL.
See here, my man, I have been told that you got the better of another rival for Cecilia's heart, and that you were not very scrupulous about the means used for the purpose. How do you think that victim liked you?
#FIANCÉ.
He was a worthless fellow.
#AXEL.
From whom you saved the girl! And now I save her from you! Good - bye!
#FIANCÉ.
Cecilia! draws back from him.
#FIANCÉ.
You seem to know your way into this place?
#AXEL.
You had better disappear!
#CECILIA.
I want some water!
#FIANCÉ.
The bottle seems to be finished! - Beware of that man, Cecilia!
#AXEL.
Oh, your presence is wholly superfluous - get out!
#FIANCÉ.
Beware of that man, Cecilia!
#AXEL.
That was a most unpleasant incident, which you might have spared me - both by breaking openly with him and by not coming to my room.
#CECILIA.
So I am to be scolded, too?
#AXEL.
Well, the responsibility had to be fixed, and now, when that's done - we can talk of something else. - How are you, to begin with?
#CECILIA.
So, so!
#AXEL.
Not well, that means?
#CECILIA.
How are you?
#AXEL.
Fine - only a little tired.
#CECILIA.
Are you going with me to see my aunt this after - noon?
#AXEL.
No, I cannot, for I have to drive out.
#CECILIA.
And that's more fun, of course. You go out such a lot, and I - never!
#AXEL.
Hm!
#CECILIA.
Why do you say "hm"?
#AXEL.
Because your remark made an unpleasant impression on me.
#CECILIA.
One gets so many unpleasant impressions these days -
#AXEL.
For instance?
#CECILIA.
By reading the papers.
#AXEL.
So you have been reading those scandalous stories about me! And you believe them?
#CECILIA.
One doesn't know what to believe.
#AXEL.
So you really suspect me of being the unscrupulous fellow pictured in those stories? And as you are nevertheless willing to marry me, I must assume that you are moved by purely practical considerations and not by any personal attraction.
#CECILIA.
You speak so harshly, as if you didn't care for me at all!
#AXEL.
Cecilia - are you willing to leave this place with me in fifteen minutes?
#CECILIA.
In fifteen minutes! For where!
#AXEL.
London.
#CECILIA.
I am not going with you until we are married.
#AXEL.
Why?
#CECILIA.
Why should we leave like that, all of a sudden?
#AXEL.
Because - it's suffocating here! And if I stay, they'll drag me down so deep that I'll never get up again.
#CECILIA.
How strange! Are you as badly off as that?
#AXEL.
Do you come with me, or do you not?
#CECILIA.
Not until we are married - for afterward you would never marry me.
#AXEL.
So that's your faith in me! - Will you sit down for a moment, then, while I go in and write a couple of letters?
#CECILIA.
Am I to sit here alone, with all the doors open?
#AXEL.
Well, don't lock the door, for then we are utterly lost.
#CECILIA.
Don't be long!
#CECILIA.
Wasn't the door locked?
#MARIE.
Not as far as I could see! - So it was meant to be locked?
#CECILIA.
I haven't the honour?
#MARIE.
Nor have I.
#CECILIA.
Why should you?
#MARIE.
How refined! Oh, I see! So it's you! And I am the victim - for a while!
#CECILIA.
I don't know you.
#MARIE.
But I know you pretty well.
#CECILIA.
Oh, you do? Come out here a moment!
#AXEL.
What do you want here?
#MARIE.
Oh, one never can tell.
#AXEL.
Then you had better clear out.
#MARIE.
Why?
#AXEL.
Because what there was between us came to an end three years ago.
#MARIE.
And now there is another one to be thrown on the scrap heap?
#AXEL.
Did I ever give you any promises that were not kept? Have I ever owed you anything? Have I ever said a word about marriage? Have we had any children together? Have I been the only one to receive your favours?
#MARIE.
But now you mean to be the only one? With that one over there!
#CECILIA.
What do you mean? - I don't know you!
#MARIE.
No, but there was a time when you did know me. And I remember that when we met in the streets we called each other by our first names. And now you are going to marry her? No, you know, you are really too good for that!
#AXEL.
Have you known that woman before?
#CECILIA.
No.
#MARIE.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself? I simply didn't recognise you at first because of your swell clothes -
#CECILIA.
Come - I'll go with you!
#AXEL.
In a moment! Just wait a while! I am only going in to write another letter - But now we'll close the door first of all.
#MARIE.
No, thank you, I don't want to be locked in as she was a while ago.
#AXEL.
Was the door locked?
#CECILIA.
You don't dare say that the door was locked!
#MARIE.
As you expected it to be locked, I suppose you had tried to lock it and had not succeeded -
#AXEL.
It always seemed to me that you were a nice girl, Marie. Will you let me have my letters back now?
#MARIE.
No.
#AXEL.
What are you going to do with them?
#MARIE.
I hear that I can sell them, now when you have become famous.
#AXEL.
And get your revenge at the same time?
#MARIE.
Exactly.
#AXEL.
Is it Lindgren - ?
#MARIE.
Yes! - And here he is now himself.
#LINDGREN.
Well, what a lot of skirts! And Marie, too - like the cuckoo that's in every nest! Now listen, Axel!
#AXEL.
I hear you even when I don't see you. You're in a fine humour - what new misfortune has befallen me?
#LINDGREN.
I was only a little sour this morning because I hadn't had a chance to get wound up. But now I've had a bite to eat - Well, you see - at bottom you don't owe me anything at all. For what I did, I did out of my heart's goodness, and it has brought me both honour and pleasure - and what you got was a gift and no loan!
#AXEL.
Now you are altogether too modest and generous.
#LINDGREN.
Not at all! However, one favour calls for another. Would you mind becoming my surety on this note?
#LINDGREN.
Well, you needn't be afraid that I'm going to put you in the same kind of fix as your brother did -
#AXEL.
What do you mean? It was I who put him -
#LINDGREN.
Yes, to the tune of two hundred crowns - but he got your name as surety for five years' rent -
#AXEL.
Jesus Christ!
#LINDGREN.
What's that? - Hm - hm!
#AXEL.
Just wait a few minutes - I have only to write a couple of letters.
#AXEL.
Just a few minutes, my dear - Just a few minutes!
#LINDGREN.
Here's the note - you might sign it while you are at it.
#AXEL.
Give it to me!
#LINDGREN.
Well, girls, are you on good terms again?
#MARIE.
Oh, yes, and before we get away, we'll be on still better terms.
#MARIE.
I should like to have some fun to - day.
#LINDGREN.
Come along with me! I'll have money!
#MARIE.
No!
#LINDGREN.
Let's take in the fireworks to - night - then we can see how a great man looks in red light - what do you say to that, Cissie dear?
#CECILIA.
Oh, I'll be sick if I have to stay here longer!
#MARIE.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
#LINDGREN.
Scrap, girls, and I'll watch you! Fight till the fur flies - won't you?
#LINDGREN.
Well, well! Old friends! How are you?
#THURE.
All right.
#LINDGREN.
And the child?
#THURE.
The child?
#LINDGREN.
Oh, you have forgotten it? - Are you equally forgetful about names?
#THURE.
Names?
#LINDGREN.
Signatures! - He must be writing an awful lot in there!
#THURE.
Is my brother, the doctor, in there?
#LINDGREN.
I don't know if the doctor is there, but your brother went in there a while ago. - And, for that matter, we might find out. Silent as the grave! Then I'll walk right in.
#CECILIA.
What can it mean?
#MARIE.
Well, we'll see now.
#THURE.
What has happened here?
#THE WIFE.
Something is up! - You'll see he doesn't help us!
#LINDGREN.
What does it say? Cyanide of potassium! - How stupid! What a sentimental idiot - to kill himself for so little - So you were no beast of prey, my dear Axel! - But - he's not there - and his things are gone, too. So he has skipped out! And the bottle has never been opened! That means - he meant to kill himself, but changed his mind! - And these are his posthumous writings. "To Miss Cecilia" - seems to contain some round object - probably an engagement ring - there you are! - "To my brother - with a piece of blue paper inside - must be a note - for the amount involved! You're welcome!
#THURE.
Do you see that he helped us after all -
#THE WIFE.
Oh, in that way!
#LINDGREN.
And here's my note - without his name - He's a strong one, all right! Diable!
#MARIE.
Then the fireworks will be called off, I suppose?
#FIANCÉ.
Was there nothing for me?
#LINDGREN.
Yes, I think there was a fiancée - somewhere over there! - I tell you, that fellow is a wonder at clearing up tangled affairs! - Of course, it makes me mad to think that I let myself be fooled - but I'll be darned if I don't think I would have done just as he did! - And so would you, perhaps? - Or what do you think?
