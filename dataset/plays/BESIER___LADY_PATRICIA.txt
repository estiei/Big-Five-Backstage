#LADY PATRICIA.
Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore Alone upon the threshold of my door Of individual life shall I command The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand Serenely in the sunshine as before, Without the sense of that which I forebore— Thy touch upon the palm—— Doom takes to part us, leaves thy hand in mine, With pulses that beat double. What I do And what I dream include thee as the wine Must taste of its own grape. And when I sue God for myself, He hears that name of thine, And sees within my eyes the tears of two.... And sees within my eyes the tears of two ... ... the tears of two.... What is it, Browning? Did I call you Browning? How absurd! I meant Ellis.... Oh, the tea! Yes, of course. Please put everything near me on the table. ... the tears of two....
#ELLIS.
I beg your pardon, my lady?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Nothing. I will look after myself. Oh, Ellis....
#ELLIS.
Yes, my lady?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You have brought only one cup.
#ELLIS.
I thought you were taking tea by yourself, my lady.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Please bring another cup.
#ELLIS.
Yes, my lady. And milk and cream, my lady?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Milk and cream.... Yes, I am afraid so. But don’t put it on the table. Hide it in the summer - house. And will you send Baldwin to me?
#ELLIS.
Yes, my lady.
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, m’lady?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Sing no sad songs—— Oh, Baldwin, what do you want?
#BALDWIN.
Mr. Ellis said as you wished to speak to me, mum.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Mr. Ellis?... Oh, yes, I remember now. What is it I wanted to tell you?
#BALDWIN.
Mr. Ellis didn’t make mention, m’lady.
#LADY PATRICIA.
How stupid of him! Baldwin....
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’um?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You ought to be very happy.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’um.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Very happy. Because you are a gardener. I can imagine no calling more beautiful. You are the father of innumerable children, and they are all lovely.
#BALDWIN.
Thank ’ee, m’lady. I’ve ’ad thirteen—and two of ’em by my first wife.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Thir - teen!... Good heavens, Baldwin, what are you talking about?
#BALDWIN.
You made mention of my family, m’lady.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, but I meant the flowers you tend and rear. The gillyflowers and eglantine, myrtle, rosemary, columbine, and daffydowndillies. Not—how strange and dreadful! Thirteen!
#BALDWIN.
I’ve ’eard tell that thirteen’s an unlucky number, m’lady. But I ain’t suspicious.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Suspicious?
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’um. And if I was, fac’s won’t change for the wishin’. Thirteen’s the number, and thirteen it’s like to remain, seeing as Mrs. Baldwin’s turned sixty - three.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I’m afraid I don’t quite understand what you’re talking about.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You needn’t repeat it.... Oh, I remember now why I sent for you, Baldwin. I wonder if, without hurting the beauty of the tree, you could open a window to the sunset?
#BALDWIN.
Open a winder?...
#LADY PATRICIA.
You don’t understand me? Let me put it differently! I should like you to cut away some of the foliage so that I can watch the sun dropping behind the hills.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, m’lady. But——
#LADY PATRICIA.
I know what you are going to say. When we built this place in the tree, I gave you special directions not to touch the western foliage as it hid the view of Ashurst Manor, which I found distressingly unsightly. Yes! But since my aunt, Mrs. O’Farrel, has taken the house, it seems to me far less offensive. Likes and dislikes are, after all, so much a matter of temperament and association! The former owner was an impossible person.
#BALDWIN.
The Scotch gentleman?
#LADY PATRICIA.
He was a Jew, Baldwin, though his name was Mackintosh. I don’t wish to speak of him. When you cut the foliage, please use restraint and feeling. On no account disfigure the tree. Watch from this spot the sun going down, and lop away a little branch here and a little branch there, so as to give me some perfect glimpses of gold and rose.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What have you got there?
#ELLIS.
The cup and saucer and the milk and cream, my lady. And I thought I had better bring whisky and soda as well, my lady.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I never told you to. I wish you wouldn’t be so enterprising. Please hide it with the cream in the summer - house. So you think I can safely trust you with this important piece of work, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do it as soon as possible, as I shall often be sitting here during these adorable summer evenings— —and I couldn’t bear to miss many sunsets like yesterday’s.
#BILL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill!
#BILL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill!... That will do, Baldwin.
#BILL.
Quite well, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Pretty middlin’, Mr. O’Farrel, sir, thank you.... Then it don’t matter showin’ up Ashurst Manor, m’lady?
#BILL.
Hullo! what’s this?
#LADY PATRICIA.
No, no, Baldwin! I wish to see it. It has suddenly grown beautiful! A fairy palace!
#BILL.
Great Scott!
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m. But——
#LADY PATRICIA.
That will do, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m.
#BILL.
What’s this about Ashurst?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I have asked Baldwin to cut away some of those branches so that I can see it. I used to loathe the sight of the house. Then your mother bought it, and I liked it. I love it now that you have come to stay there.... You may kiss me, Bill.
#BILL.
May I?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You may kiss me again.
#BILL.
May I?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You may kiss me again.
#BILL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, how I’ve longed for this moment—how I’ve longed for it!... All these weary months I’ve lived in the past and future, on memories and anticipations. Now, at last I have the present—I have reality—you—to have and to hold—you—you.... Kiss me.
#BILL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Hush! We mustn’t be foolish.... Sit down.... So you got my telegram?
#BILL.
Directly the boat came alongside. But it took me a deuce of a time to make out! My French is a bit rusty, and the rotters had jumbled up some of the words. As it is, I only made out the gist of it—to take an earlier train from London than I’d intended, and to call on you before going on to Ashurst, as I’d find you alone in a summer - house you’d built on some tree or other. The twiddly bits of the message didn’t somehow seem to make sense....
#LADY PATRICIA.
The ... twiddly bits?
#BILL.
Yes; something about a star in red water, and horses with white manes. Couldn’t make it out at all.
#LADY PATRICIA.
That was a quotation from De Musset, my poor boy.
#BILL.
Great Scott! I thought it was a cypher. People don’t generally quote poetry in their telegrams.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I do.
#BILL.
In any case, it seemed to me a bit rash of you to send the wire at all—even in French.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, did it? As a matter of fact, I used French, not to conceal the message, but because the language seemed to me so beautifully appropriate for making a clandestine meeting.
#BILL.
By Jove! Fancy thinking of that!
#LADY PATRICIA.
To sin beautifully is the less a sin. Don’t forget, dear, that, however innocent, our love is wrong. We should never neglect an opportunity of ennobling it with little touches of beauty, should we?
#BILL.
Rather not!... So Michael’s away?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Only this afternoon. He has gone to a garden party at the Fitzgeralds’. Your mother’s there as well. Everybody’s there. But I wanted to see you for a little while before any one else, so I sent you that wire and pretended a headache. A petty deceit that avenged itself! For directly I told it, I felt a slight twinge of neuralgia.
#BILL.
Hard luck! But it’s better, dear, isn’t it?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I suppose it is. But you mustn’t say “hard luck.” My life, alas! is so full of deceits that when one of them is punished, I always try to be grateful. But tell me now, about yourself—everything that has happened these last months. Your letters have been too full of facts to tell me anything. And I do so long to hear all your news....
#BILL.
Patricia....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, dear?
#BILL.
What an awfully good woman you are!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Am I?... I wonder!
#BILL.
And your eyes are simply ripping.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Are they?
#BILL.
And your hands, by Jove!
#LADY PATRICIA.
What of my hands, dear?
#BILL.
They’re simply ripping.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Dear heart! Dear soft hair. But I’m waiting.
#BILL.
Oh yes, I forgot. But there really ain’t much to tell that I haven’t told you in my letters. I arrived in New York on a Saturday after an awfully jolly passage. Those big Cunarders are corking boats. Had a bit of a dust - up at the Customs, but I squared the chap with a ten - dollar bill. A chap on board advised me to put up at the Waldorf - Astoria. He told me it was one of their swaggerest hotels, but I must say——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, yes, dear, you’ve told me all that before! And about the nigger waiter whose thumb was always in the soup—and the Californian peach as big as a baby’s head—and the factory that was burned down in Chicago—and the card - sharper who tried to swindle you at poker, “but he got hold of the wrong chap, by Jove!”—and so many other thrilling details. You darling! Oh, you darling!
#BILL.
I thought I’d told you everything.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Of course you did—everything. I wonder why I am so foolish as to expect the essentials from you—those labourings of the soul at midnight, yearnings, ecstasies, and long, long thoughts under the stars. If you had been capable of these I should never have loved you. It’s just your simplicity and eternal boyishness that took my heart. Poor Michael’s spiritual nature, his dreams, his subtlety, his devotion, never touched me deeper than the intellect. I mistook sympathy for love—I seemed to have found a kindred spirit—I married him. Yes! we are all born to suffer and endure.... Which reminds me, my poor dear boy, you must be dying for tea. I hope you had some lunch?
#BILL.
Rather! I had a luncheon - basket in the train, and put away the best part of a chicken, among other things.
#LADY PATRICIA.
How young and hungry you are!
#BILL.
I say!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, dear?
#BILL.
Have you any milk or cream?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, Bill!...
#BILL.
I can’t help it. This Russian mess ain’t a Christian drink. I can’t think how you can swallow it.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I don’t suppose I like it any better than you, dear. But the mixture of cream and tea, as I have often told you, produces an odious colour—and I refuse to encourage it. You should try to do likewise.... However, you will find cream in the summer - house.
#BILL.
Right - ho! Hullo! Good man! Here’s whisky - and - soda. That’s the stuff! Nothing like a syphonated spot when one’s got a real thirst! No tea for me, thanks.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Dear babbler....
#BILL.
Here’s to you, Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
We are all born to suffer, to endure, to renounce....
#BILL.
Oh, well! I’ll drink that Russian stuff if you like.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I was not thinking of tea. I was thinking of life.
#BILL.
Yes, it’s an awfully hard world. By Jove, that’s clinking good!
#LADY PATRICIA.
It becomes more and more difficult to play my part, and return Michael’s love, which seems to grow stronger and deeper day by day. His eyes follow my every movement, his mind anticipates my every wish, he surrounds me with an atmosphere of passionate worship. Few women have ever received such love. It is the love that poets dream of—the love that must follow those marriages that are made in heaven.
#BILL.
Good Lord, it’s awfully rough on you!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I think and I think and I think, but I can see no solution to the mystery. Surely love is the best gift of God, and that such love as Michael’s—so noble, so pure, so unselfish—should be utterly wasted, is inconceivable. It must be that I am unworthy.
#BILL.
And it puts me in such a rotten position. If Michael treated you badly, I shouldn’t care a rap how much I made love to you.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Can it be that I am unworthy?
#BILL.
As it is I often feel such a beastly cad....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Then you think me unworthy?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You never denied it.
#BILL.
But I didn’t know you wanted me to! You’re worthy of anything! You know that!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Dear, dear boy! But am I? I wonder! Heaven only knows how desperately I tried to love him, and when I found it impossible, how I never faltered in pretending a love equal to his. And I knew that it would kill him should he learn the truth. But if the part I played was difficult before you came, after you came, and I knew what love was, it was almost beyond my power. And yet I drew strength somehow, not only to resist temptation and keep our love pure, but never by word, deed, or expression to let Michael suspect for one moment that his devotion was not returned. Yes! I think a woman who has done all this cannot be altogether unworthy.
#BILL.
You’re—you’re a saint—you’re an angel!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Am I? I wonder!
#BILL.
You really are!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Dear, inarticulate boy!... And, Bill, remember this. We have put our hands to the plough, and there must be no turning back. The martyrdom which must be lifelong has only just begun. I feel I shall find strength to play my bitter rôle to the final curtain. For I love renunciation, endurance, and purity. They are such exquisite virtues. And virtue is very beautiful.... But you are made of more earthly materials, my poor boy. Do you realise that your love must always remain unsatisfied? Can you love me without the faintest hope of more reward than a look, a touch, a kiss?...
#BILL.
That’s all right, Patricia. Don’t you worry about me.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But you are young and vigorous and passionate....
#BILL.
That’s all right!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I can only offer you the shadow; your nature will some day cry out for the substance.
#BILL.
Not it!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ah, if only I had the strength and courage to bid you good - bye for ever!
#BILL.
I shouldn’t go.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ah, Bill!...
#BALDWIN.
If you please, ’m....
#BILL.
What the devil are you doing here?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Well, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
If you please, m’lady, I thought as I ’ad best watch the sun early. It’s close on six ’m, and I thought as p’raps you’d like some branches lopped ’igher up. The sun’s a fine sight at six, mum—much more light in it than a hour later, an’ it’s a neasier job loppin’ they ’igher branches than them out there, as I shan’t need no ladder.
#BILL.
Quite mad!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I don’t want to sit here and look at the sun through a pair of smoked glasses. You may return here when the sun is lower.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, m’lady. But——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Go away....
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Very tiresome, isn’t he?
#BILL.
I don’t half like the old ass catching us like that.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Catching us?
#BILL.
Yes, fairly caught us in the act....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill!
#BILL.
Well, he must have seen me kiss you. I don’t half like it.
#LADY PATRICIA.
How very bourgeois you are!
#BILL.
Well, I don’t know about that. But——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Not bourgeois, then! No, no! Young and self - conscious! Fancy getting red and embarrassed because a gardener saw you looking affectionate!... Dear, dear boy!... Now sit down again and listen. I caught an impression of the sunset yesterday, a few lines, but I believe they are precious—not precieux—precious in the true sense of the word.... Don’t you hate this modern artistic jargon?
#BILL.
Rather!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Listen.... A dreamy blue invests the lonely hill, Far off against the orient green and cold; Silence declines upon these branches old; The level land is still; The lofty azure deepens; faintlier glows The delicate beauty of the sunset rose; And pensive grey encroaches on the gold. Tenderly coloured, are they not?
#BILL.
Yours?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Mine.
#BILL.
Ripping!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ripping.... Oh, how unpleasant! Say that other word instead.
#BILL.
What word?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I don’t quite know. Something to do with bottles.
#BILL.
Clinking?
#LADY PATRICIA.
No.... Something to do with wine....
#BILL.
Oh! you mean—corking.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, corking.
#BILL.
Right - ho!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Thank you, dear.... And so you like my lines?
#BILL.
They’re corking. And so’s your voice when you read ’em.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I write corking verses, and I read them with a corking voice. Oh, Bill! Oh, my dear——
#BILL.
Yes?
#LADY PATRICIA.
How I wish that you and I were alone on a little island in the Ægean Archipelago!... Hush! Do you hear? A motor - car coming up the drive! You can see if you look through the branches there. Be careful, dear. Don’t let any one see you.
#BILL.
Great Scott!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes?
#BILL.
It’s the mater’s car, and——
#LADY PATRICIA.
It’s stopping! Oh, Bill——
#BILL.
The mater and Michael, and the Dean—and who’s the jolly - looking girl?
#LADY PATRICIA.
With a face like a naughty boy’s?
#BILL.
Yes.
#LADY PATRICIA.
That must be Clare Lesley. Michael has been very kind to her lately. He is trying to give her a serious view of life.
#BILL.
I say, you don’t mean to tell me that’s Clare, the Dean’s daughter? Why, I thought she was a flapper! flapper?...
#BILL.
Yes. When last I saw her, a little more than a year ago, her skirts weren’t much below her knees, and——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Flapper.... What a strange word! How do you spell it? With a “ph”?
#BILL.
No, with a double p. Hullo!
#LADY PATRICIA.
What is it?
#BILL.
They’re all coming here!
#LADY PATRICIA.
No!
#BILL.
They are, by Jove! The whole crowd. What shall we do?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Your mother and Michael mustn’t find you here. You must fly!
#BILL.
That’s all very well. But where can I go to? They’re bound to spot me if I get down the steps.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, but can’t you climb somewhere up the tree and hide yourself like a bird among the branches?
#BILL.
What?...
#LADY PATRICIA.
It’s the only thing to do. And so simple! And so romantic!
#BILL.
Yes, that’s all right. But supposing they see me—what am I to say?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, anything! Use a little imagination.... Say you are looking for birds’ eggs. But they won’t see you if you lie along that thick branch up there.
#BILL.
Birds’ - nesting....
#LADY PATRICIA.
I shall pretend to be asleep.
#BILL.
Why?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Why not?
#BILL.
I’ll look such a bally ass if they spot me....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill!
#BILL.
Eh?
#LADY PATRICIA.
This glass mustn’t be found here.
#BILL.
By Jove!
#LADY PATRICIA.
And the cup and saucer....
#BILL.
Good Lord!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Put them into your pockets.
#BILL.
But——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Quick—quick! Now the tea. No! no! they might see or hear. Drink it.
#BILL.
I really couldn’t.
#LADY PATRICIA.
For my sake.
#BILL.
Muck! By Jove, they’re nearly here!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I really must have another ladder built on this side.
#BILL.
I hope they won’t see me climbing.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Be small—for my sake....
#BILL.
I say....
#LADY PATRICIA.
S - sh!...
#BILL.
It’s all right. They’re standin’ about talkin’. Can you see me?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Where are you?
#BILL.
Here.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, yes, I see....
#BILL.
The devil you do! What part o’ me?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Er—well—your—your back....
#BILL.
Damn! Oh, confound this beastly cup and saucer! They keep on rattling.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Put the saucer in the other pocket.
#BILL.
The glass is in the other pocket.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Have you only two pockets?
#BILL.
Hush! they’re coming.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Ah.... I’m green with envy of you, Dean! You’re at least five years my senior, and your wind is as sound as your doctrines. Look at me! I can’t climb a tree without getting—what’s the word, Clare?
#CLARE.
Punctured.
#DEAN.
My dear child!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Scold me, Dean, scold me! I meant the word, but hadn’t the pluck to say it.
#MICHAEL.
And how do you like our little eyrie, Mrs. O’Farrel?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Charming, Michael, charming! It’s quite worth getting—getting—give me the word, Clare.
#CLARE.
Winded.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Yes, it’s quite worth getting punctured—and winded—to see the view from here, Michael. How like you and Patricia to think of such a piece of arboreal sentimentality! Now whose idea—— Why, Patricia!
#DEAN.
Delightful!
#MICHAEL.
S - sh.... She’s asleep....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Asleep! I should think she was, for my strident voice not to awake her!
#CLARE.
Perhaps she’s shamming.
#DEAN.
My dear child!
#MICHAEL.
We must be very careful not to wake her. She had a bad headache this morning.... See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
#DEAN.
I would I were a glove upon that hand!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Dean!
#CLARE.
Shocking!
#DEAN.
And why? I love all that is beautiful with all my senses.... And why shouldn’t I?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Because such youthful depravity makes me envious again.
#DEAN.
Pardon me, my dear lady, I remember you far too well as a girl to believe that even now—
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Michael!... Will you and Clare take the car and meet Bill’s train? It won’t take you ten minutes; I’m too comfortable to move at present. Besides, we must have the place to ourselves, the Dean and I, as he is becoming indiscreetly reminiscent. Bring Bill back with you here, and he and I will drive home together.... You don’t mind?
#MICHAEL.
I shall be delighted.
#CLARE.
I’m not surprised you want to get rid of me, pater, if you’re going to talk about your gay youth. You must have been an awful rip.
#DEAN.
Really, Clare!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
It was my gay youth your father was threatening us with.
#CLARE.
You must have been a dear then, as now!...
#MICHAEL.
Will you kindly keep the flies off Patricia’s face while I’m away?
#DEAN.
Oh, delighted! Delighted!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
When duty and pleasure are combined, there’s no reason to hesitate. I saw a fly settle on Patricia’s chin.
#DEAN.
Happy fly!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
How very strange! And not a breath of wind!
#DEAN.
Merely a squirrel. I believe I caught sight of its tail.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I hope the tree’s not rotten. I’m considerably heavier than a squirrel!
#DEAN.
Oh, softly, please....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Softly yourself!
#DEAN.
Did you ever see the like?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What are you talking about?
#DEAN.
The wonder of this sleeping woman. Was there ever anything more beautiful?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I thought you knew better than to praise one woman to another.
#DEAN.
Oh, but you are not another! You are Eileen who, ever since I met her in short skirts, have been the fairest of all.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fiddle - de - dee! I’m old and ugly!
#DEAN.
No woman can ever be old and ugly—you least of all.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Charming old humbug! Well, I agree with you—Patricia’s certainly ornamental.
#DEAN.
The pose, my dear lady, the pose! Unstudied grace of abandonment, artless perfection! Perfection as a whole, perfection in detail! Consider the right hand: so blissfully burdened. Consider the left: still clasping some poem only less exquisite than itself. The eyelids are faintly blue—surely with the sky of a delicate dream. From head to foot every curve is a lyric—from head—I should like to see her foot.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Haven’t you the courage?
#DEAN.
I beg your pardon?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
To look at it.
#DEAN.
Mrs. O’Farrel!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, if I admired her feet as much as you do, I shouldn’t hesitate.
#DEAN.
But supposing she woke and found me—er—er—
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Arranging her skirt?... My dear man, I know Patricia; she would gladly show you several inches of her ankle.
#DEAN.
Eileen, you’re a wicked woman!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And you’re a scandalous example of clerical depravity!
#DEAN.
Tut, tut, tut, my dear!... Eileen, do you know why I went into the Church?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
You thought it a convenient cloak for your peccadilloes.
#DEAN.
Out of sheer gratitude to my Maker for creating woman.... Eileen, why did you refuse to marry me?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
There must be at least half a dozen flies on Patricia’s face.
#DEAN.
Never mind the flies—it’s their turn for the moment.... Why did you refuse me, Eileen?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Because my love for you made me a blind fool! I misunderstood your admiration for women. I thought your homage of every girl you met, personal—not universal, as I learned too late—a superb compliment to the whole sex. Dear friend, I repented in sackcloth and ashes! Not that O’Farrel wasn’t a good fellow, every inch of him. He made life very happy. But life with you—well, I missed it!
#DEAN.
Will you marry me, Eileen?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No.
#DEAN.
Why not?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I’m far too old for a boy like you.
#DEAN.
Is this final?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Final.
#DEAN.
Ah!... Your companionship would have been so good for Clare. A tactfully restraining influence....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I doubt it. I’m too much in sympathy with the child.
#DEAN.
But you wouldn’t encourage her to tell every one she meets—including the Bishop—that she is an Atheist, or ride astride through the town without the formality of—er—divided skirts....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No—perhaps not. I should first of all put a stop to her galavantin’ about every other day with Michael.
#DEAN.
Really, my dear Eileen, I think the friendship between Michael Cosway and Clare is wholly charming and can only do the child good. Surely you don’t——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No, of course I don’t! Michael’s far too infatuated with your sleeping beauty there. Still, I’d put a stop to it. And then I should marry your daughter to Bill with indecent haste.
#DEAN.
Eh, what? Your son? Dear me!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Why shouldn’t they marry? They are obviously kindred spirits.
#DEAN.
I don’t know your son sufficiently well to—er——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
thoroughly healthy, young animal.... You’ll meet him in a moment. I hear the motor....
#DEAN.
How quick they’ve been!... Marry them! Dear me!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Now then, Mr. Dean, to work!
#DEAN.
I don’t quite——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Patricia’s flies! If Michael catches you idling!
#DEAN.
Now, fancy my forgetting it!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
But where’s Bill? Have you people dropped my only son out of the car?
#CLARE.
He never turned up!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Nonsense! He wired from Southampton that——
#MICHAEL.
S - s - sh! You might wake Patricia!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh, confound Patricia!
#CLARE.
But——
#DEAN.
Dear me!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, I never!
#MICHAEL.
What on earth!
#CLARE.
There’s some one up the tree!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
The squirrel....
#DEAN.
Most awkward....
#MICHAEL.
Don’t be alarmed, Patricia. Who are you, sir? What are you doing there? Come down at once.... Do you hear me, sir?
#BILL.
All right—I’m coming....
#CLARE.
There he is, Mike! I see his leg!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Mike? Hm!
#MICHAEL.
Bill!
#BILL.
Hullo!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Bill? Bill!
#BILL.
How are you, mother? How - de - do, Mr. Dean? How - de - do, Miss Lesley? How’s yourself, Michael?
#LADY PATRICIA.
And have you no greeting for poor me, Cousin Bill?
#BILL.
Oh, I say, I’m awfully sorry! How - de - do, Cousin Patricia?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
But what on earth were you doing up the tree?
#BILL.
Birds’ - nesting.
#MRS.
O’FARREL, MICHAEL, DEAN. Birds’ - nesting?
#CLARE.
And you took a saucer up with you to put the eggs in?
#BILL.
Oh, did I?
#CLARE.
Of course. It’s the usual thing to do when you go birds’ - nesting. Didn’t you always take a saucer with you as a boy, Mr. Cosway?
#MICHAEL.
I can’t say I remember doing so.
#CLARE.
So long ago that you’ve forgotten? I’ve read somewhere that when they look for ostrich - eggs in America they take soup - tureens.
#BILL.
I say ...!
#MICHAEL.
There are no ostriches in America.
#CLARE.
Then I wonder why they look for ostrich - eggs.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Do stop talking nonsense, Clare!... Really, Bill, I’m curious to know quite a lot of things. Why did you take an earlier train? Why did you come here? Why did you climb up the tree with a saucer? Why did you let Michael and Miss Lesley fetch you at the station? And why did you remain in the tree while the Dean and I—er——
#DEAN.
Talked over old times together.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Talked over old times together. It’s all rather mysterious.
#DEAN.
Unusual....
#BILL.
I dropped a rotten branch.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Quite so. And the Dean thought a squirrel had done it.
#BILL.
Oh yes, you caught sight of my tail!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
That’s all very well. But what was your idea in playing such a prank? It seems to me rather childish.
#DEAN.
Primitive....
#MICHAEL.
Very.
#CLARE.
Quite.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, my dear, dear friends, why do you take this so heavily? Surely a charming piece of boyishness! May I tell them what happened, Cousin Bill? I saw through the whole thing at once.
#BILL.
I’m sure you did.
#LADY PATRICIA.
He so longed to see his mother that he came down by an earlier train.... Didn’t you, Cousin Bill?
#BILL.
That’s right.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But when he arrived he found she had gone to a garden party. He was so disappointed.... Weren’t you, Cousin Bill?
#BILL.
That’s right.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Did you learn to say “that’s right” in America? It sounds so successful.... When he found his mother was out, he thought he would come and see Michael and—me. Michael had gone to the garden party, but he was told that I was here. He found me asleep....
#CLARE.
And he kissed me—didn’t you, Cousin Bill?
#LADY PATRICIA.
He found me asleep. I had not been feeling very well....
#MICHAEL.
Are you better, my darling?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Thank you, Michael dear, a little better.... He found me asleep. He was thirsty, poor fellow! So he helped himself to tea. Providentially, Ellis had brought two cups. Then he saw you all coming, and thought it would be “such jolly fun” to climb up the tree and drop a saucer.... Didn’t you?
#CLARE.
—Cousin Bill.
#LADY PATRICIA.
He had meant to do it at once. But he couldn’t resist the joke of letting Clare and Michael fetch him at the station. And when they had gone he simply had to wait till they came back again—or, perhaps, the Dean and Aunt Eileen were so enjoying each other’s company, he hadn’t the heart to disturb them.... Then Clare and Michael returned, and he thought the joke had gone far enough.
#CLARE.
So he threw a saucer at us.
#MICHAEL.
Crown Derby....
#BILL.
Sorry.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Isn’t that more or less the true story, Cousin Bill?
#BILL.
I say, what an awfully clever woman you are!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Am I?... I wonder!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Clever at writing verses, Patricia. But prose fiction’s not in your line. Bill we must be off. There’s barely time to dress, and some people are dining with us to - night.
#BILL.
All right, mother. I say, Miss Lesley, when last we met you had long hair.
#CLARE.
I still have long hair, Mr. O’Farrel.
#BILL.
Oh, but what I meant was——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Your father tells me you are dining with us, Clare. I’m so glad!
#CLARE.
If you don’t mind me in this dress, Lady Patricia. Mr. Cosway has promised to show me the—er—what’s its name?
#MICHAEL.
The spiral nebula in Andromeda.
#BILL.
How much? cluster of minute stars in the constellation of Andromeda. I say stars designedly. For I differ from many authorities in believing this nebula to be irresolvable or gaseous. Indeed, the remarkable observations of Sir William McKechnie leave no doubt in my mind that this so - called nebula is an external galaxy. In which case——
#BILL.
Oh, help! So you still rot about with a telescope, Michael?
#MICHAEL.
I am greatly interested in astronomy.
#BILL.
You, too?
#CLARE.
I like the stars....
#LADY PATRICIA.
I’m so sorry! I was trying to persuade your father to stay with you, Clare. But he’s bent on putting finishing - touches to to - morrow’s sermon.
#MICHAEL.
I’ll see Miss Lesley home, of course.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Can we drop you at the Deanery?
#DEAN.
It’s very kind of you.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Come along, Bill. Good - bye, all!
#BILL.
I’ve left the cup and glass up the tree. Good - bye, Cousin Patricia.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Good - bye, Cousin Bill.
#BILL.
Good - bye, Clare.
#CLARE.
Clare?
#BILL.
Yes. Sorry about the saucer. Good - bye.
#CLARE.
Cheek!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#MICHAEL.
Patricia! And the poor head is really better, darling? I’m so glad you were able to sleep!
#LADY PATRICIA.
And my sleep was full of dreams, Michael. Strange and mystic dreams—oh, and such beautiful dreams! For they all led up to a vision of my dearest’s face.
#MICHAEL.
Heart of my heart!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Soul of my soul!
#MICHAEL.
Patricia....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael....
#MICHAEL.
One night I shall find a new star in the depths of the sky——
#LADY PATRICIA.
One day I shall write a poem that will ring down the ages——
#MICHAEL.
And the star shall be called Patricia.
#LADY PATRICIA.
And the poem—Michael.
#MICHAEL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#BALDWIN.
Beggin’ yer pardon, sir, but there be summin’ white movin’ about up the tree.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Baldwin!
#BALDWIN.
It a’most looks to me as though a young lady ’ad climbed up the tree, sir.
#MICHAEL.
What on earth——!
#CLARE.
Don’t you dare to look up here, Baldwin—nor you, Mi—Mr. Cosway! If there’s something white to be seen it’s certainly not for you to look at! D’you hear me, Baldwin? Oh! Tell him to turn his head somewhere else.
#MICHAEL.
Baldwin!
#BALDWIN.
Yessir?
#LADY PATRICIA.
But, my dear child, what are you doing there?
#CLARE.
Birds’ - nesting.
#MICHAEL AND LADY PATRICIA.
Birds’ - nesting!
#CLARE.
I don’t believe there’s a nest here at all. He was simply kidding us.
#BALDWIN.
If it’s h’eggs you’re wantin’, miss, there’s a rare lot of ’em in the ivy up at the ’ouse. Sparrers—drat’em!
#LADY PATRICIA.
What an amazing young creature! But you’ll ruin your frock, my child.
#CLARE.
I can’t help that. I mean to find out whether there’s a nest here or not. Besides, I simply couldn’t hang around while you and Mr. Cosway were canoodleing.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Canoodleing?
#CLARE.
Spooning.
#LADY PATRICIA.
How very vulgar you can be!
#CLARE.
Can’t I!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I think it would be very pleasant to dine here, Michael. I’ll go indoors and change into something warmer.
#MICHAEL.
You’re not cold, my love?
#LADY PATRICIA.
No, no, dear, no. But I might be later on. What are you doing, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
It’s main ’ard to keep a h’eye on the sun, m’lady, an’ mine ain’t no longer w’at they was. Might I arst, mum, if the sun’s ’bout right for loppin’ off they branches?
#MICHAEL.
Lopping off the branches?
#CLARE.
Oh! I’ve found a cup! cup!
#CLARE.
And a glass! cup and a glass!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, I suppose Cousin Bill left them up there. You needn’t trouble to bring them down, Clare. Baldwin can fetch them.
#CLARE.
He seems to have been doing himself uncommonly well. I daresay I shall find plates, knives and forks, napkins and finger - bowls. What ho!
#MICHAEL.
Has that fellow gone quite off his head?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill? Oh, no, dear! Oh, no! It’s only youth—youth will out! Beautiful rose - white youth! When all the world is young, lad, And every goose a swan, lad, Then, hey! for boot and horse, lad, Young blood must have its course, lad,
#CLARE.
Mike!
#MICHAEL.
Yes?
#CLARE.
Has she gone?
#MICHAEL.
Yes.
#CLARE.
Mike.
#MICHAEL.
Yes?
#CLARE.
Why is she like a collar?
#MICHAEL.
I don’t know.
#CLARE.
Because she’s always round your neck.
#MICHAEL.
Oh....
#CLARE.
You and she are enough to make a saint ill. You ought to have more tact than to spoon about in public. Mike.
#MICHAEL.
Yes?
#CLARE.
Sulky?
#MICHAEL.
No.
#CLARE.
What’s up, then?
#MICHAEL.
Nothing.
#CLARE.
I’m coming down. There’s not a nest to be seen anywhere. By Jove, I am in a mess! It’s all your fault for driving me up a tree with your disgusting billing and cooing.
#MICHAEL.
Don’t....
#CLARE.
Sorry. No, no! Stay where you are! And don’t look up here. Oh, damn!... Sorry! But I’ve torn my frock and ripped open the hooks behind. All your fault.
#MICHAEL.
You shall have another frock.
#CLARE.
Thanks.
#MICHAEL.
Two frocks.
#CLARE.
No—one and a pinafore. Oh, confound this branch!... I think the pater would draw the line at two frocks. At last!... Hullo, Baldwin, I thought you had gone....
#BALDWIN.
No, miss.
#MICHAEL.
What are you doing here, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
The mistress’s orders, sir. I was to keep a h’eye on the sun.
#MICHAEL.
Keep a h’eye on the sun? What do you mean?
#BALDWIN.
’Er ladyship said as I was to keep a h’eye on the sun, so as to lop away the branches.
#MICHAEL.
I don’t understand in the least what you are talking about. Come back later on.
#BALDWIN.
Yessir. But the mistress’s orders——
#MICHAEL.
Yes, yes—another time. I’m busy now.
#BALDWIN.
Yessir....
#CLARE.
And now perhaps, sir, you will keep a h’eye on me, while I show you the result of your ’andiwork!
#MICHAEL.
My dear child!... But in common fairness, you can’t put all the blame on me.
#CLARE.
Well, I shan’t say anything more at present, since you’re going to give me a new frock. Oh, dear! I wish it were gloves.
#MICHAEL.
A dozen pair....
#CLARE.
All right—five and three - quarters. Now then—pins.
#MICHAEL.
Pins?
#CLARE.
Yes, pins. Look alive!
#MICHAEL.
I’ll be back in a moment.
#CLARE.
No, stay here. Your tie - pin will do for one. I’ve a safety - pin here , and another somewhere in my collar.... Bring a cushion here. cushion?...
#CLARE.
Yes—a cushion. Put it down.
#MICHAEL.
The cushion?...
#CLARE.
Don’t play the giddy goat, Mike! Put the cushion on the ground.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, yes—yes, of course.
#CLARE.
Kneel down.
#MICHAEL.
Eh?
#CLARE.
Kneel on the cushion. I want to spare your old joints.
#MICHAEL.
Oh....
#CLARE.
Now we’ll see if you’re worth your keep. Here are two safety - pins. Make that tear look respectable.
#MICHAEL.
But——
#CLARE.
If these safety - pins aren’t enough, use your tie - pin.
#MICHAEL.
Very well.
#CLARE.
I shall want you afterwards to fasten up the hooks behind.... How are you getting on?
#MICHAEL.
All right, thanks.
#CLARE.
What’s that boy like?
#MICHAEL.
What boy?
#CLARE.
Bill O’Farrel.
#MICHAEL.
He’s given you a fair specimen of himself in the silly prank he played just now.
#CLARE.
Oh, that seemed to me rather a sporting thing to do. sporting thing!
#CLARE.
Yes. To make an utter ass of himself, and then carry it off with a string of lies. How are you getting on?
#MICHAEL.
I think that looks better.
#CLARE.
It’ll have to do, anyhow.... Now for the hooks. Begin at the top. I daresay some of the eyes have got torn. I gave the dress an awful wrench on the tree. Do the best you can.... Oh, don’t fumble about like that!
#MICHAEL.
Clare....
#CLARE.
Well?
#MICHAEL.
I love you....
#CLARE.
Have you finished all the hooks?
#MICHAEL.
The hooks?... I—I beg your pardon.... Are you angry with me?
#CLARE.
I don’t know.
#MICHAEL.
You must have known for some time that I loved you.
#CLARE.
Then why do you always annoy me by making love to—to your wife when I’m there? Why don’t you speak?
#MICHAEL.
Clare——
#CLARE.
Oh, get up from that cushion! You don’t know what a fool you look! Well, Mike?
#MICHAEL.
Since I have spoken so much and done you wrong and Patricia wrong, I must tell you all and throw myself on your mercy.... When I married Patricia I sincerely believed I loved her. She seemed to me a kindred spirit—with her sensitive, beautiful nature. I found out too late that love depends as often on mutual difference as mutual sympathy. My love for her never went deeper than the intellect. Oh, the tragedy of it! She is such a fair, white soul, and so worthy of my whole love!...
#CLARE.
If you don’t love her, why do you pretend to?
#MICHAEL.
Can’t you see—can’t you see I have no alternative? Patricia’s love for me is unearthly in its depth and intensity. She worships me, little as I deserve it. If for one moment she thought my love had slackened, that moment would be her last. You don’t know how sensitive she is.... Do you suppose, Clare, I enjoy playing this dreadful game? But I must—it is my duty. I have sworn to love and cherish her.
#CLARE.
Michael, how long have you loved me?
#MICHAEL.
Almost since first I met you, you wild thing! You soul of youth and incarnation of the morning!
#CLARE.
Oh, you poor old thing! Mike, you may if you like.
#MICHAEL.
Clare....
#CLARE.
Get it over soon. Didn’t you like it?...
#MICHAEL.
But the wrong I am doing you, and the wrong I am doing Patricia....
#CLARE.
But if Patricia doesn’t know and I don’t mind, I don’t see where the wrong comes in.... Do you?
#MICHAEL.
Do you love me, Clare?
#CLARE.
I don’t know.... Yes, I think I do. You’re such a solemn old donkey!... Michael, if I love you, will it really make you a happier man?
#MICHAEL.
Happier? Oh, my dear, with the knowledge of your love I should be able to endure anything!
#CLARE.
Even Patricia?
#MICHAEL.
Hush, Clare, hush!... Patricia’s is a pure and delicate soul. It is I who am unworthy, since I cannot return her wonderful love.... Little girl, do you understand that this love of yours may bring much suffering into your life? I can never, by word or deed, change my attitude towards Patricia—never! She must never know that I do not love her.... And what of us? Our love must stand alone in the world. It must be something wholly pure and noble and self - sacrificing—the love that asks for nothing, that hopes for nothing—the love of the angels that neither marry nor are given in marriage.... Do you realise all this?
#CLARE.
Yes.... You see, Mike, I always believe in platonic love.
#MICHAEL.
Platonic....
#CLARE.
Well, platonic lovers do kiss each other now and then ... don’t they?
#MICHAEL.
I believe they do.
#CLARE.
And, Mike....
#MICHAEL.
Well?
#CLARE.
I don’t want you to give me that frock.
#MICHAEL.
But——
#CLARE.
Or the gloves.
#MICHAEL.
But why not, Clare? I don’t understand....
#CLARE.
Don’t you, old boy? Neither do I. But I’d much rather you didn’t—now.
#MICHAEL.
Surely, dear——
#CLARE.
Hush!... And I’m going home now. Don’t try to prevent me, like a good chap. And I want to walk back alone.
#LADY PATRICIA.
We’ve come just at the wonderful moment, Baldwin. All the west is a ritual of gold. Here’s poor Baldwin deeply grieved because he’s shooed away every time he gets to work!
#MICHAEL.
He didn’t seem to be doing anything particular, dearest, when I sent him away.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But, Michael——
#CLARE.
Don’t you remember he was keeping a h’eye on the sun?
#LADY PATRICIA.
But, Clare! What a dreadful state you’re in!
#CLARE.
I know. Your trees are shockingly dirty. You really ought to get Baldwin to scrub them with soap and water!... Lady Patricia, I hope you won’t think me very rude if I run away. I had quite forgotten it was father’s sermon night when I accepted Mr. Cosway’s invitation to dinner. I always help him with his sermons.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You, my dear child!
#CLARE.
I verify the quotations and prune the adjectives.... Then you’ll forgive me?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Sweet girl! I’m very sorry, because I’m going to do such a wicked and decadent thing at dinner. You see this lily? So virginal and nun - like! I am going to put her into a glassful of wine and make her tipsy.
#CLARE.
Oh!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
You must come some other evening. We are both so very fond of you.
#CLARE.
Good - bye. Good - bye, Mr. Cosway.
#MICHAEL.
Are you sure you don’t want me to come with you?
#CLARE.
Quite, thanks. Good - bye.
#LADY PATRICIA.
She seems to be in a chastened frame of mind.
#MICHAEL.
Perhaps she’s not quite well.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael....
#MICHAEL.
Dearest!
#LADY PATRICIA.
It will be just—just you and I!
#MICHAEL.
You and I, Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
You needn’t stay, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, mum?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You needn’t stay.
#BALDWIN.
But if you’ll excuse my sayin’ so, mum, the sun——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Another time, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Yes, ’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Just you and I, Michael.... Kiss me.
#MICHAEL.
Just you and I.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You and I and the sunset....
#BALDWIN.
Ho! Them little lanterns do burn uncommon quick.... Whoa! Uncommon quick ... drat ’em.... Whoa! Ho!... Whoa.... They do burn oncommon quick—drat ’em.... Whoa....
#BILL.
Whew.... safe! Damn! Damn!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill.... Bill.... Ah, my dear!
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, m’lady?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh!... Baldwin! How amusing!... I was looking for—Mr. Cosway. Has he been here?
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, when?
#BALDWIN.
’E took corfee ’ere with your ladyship, mum, and ’is Very Reverence, and the young lady and Mrs. O’Farrel and Mr. O’Farrel.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Sometimes, Baldwin, I wonder whether your amazing futility may not be a conscious pose.
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, mum?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh, never mind....
#CLARE.
Safe!
#MICHAEL.
Clare—Clare....
#CLARE.
Damn!
#MICHAEL.
Clare.... Clare, my—— Oh! I was looking for Lady Patricia. Have you seen her, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Yessir.
#MICHAEL.
Oh.... Has she been here?
#BALDWIN.
Yessir.
#MICHAEL.
When?
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, sir?
#MICHAEL.
When was Lady Patricia here?
#BALDWIN.
Well, sir, it may ’a been two minutes ago, sir, or it may ’a been——
#MICHAEL.
Thank you.
#BALDWIN.
Or it may ’a been three. ’Er ladyship were looking for you, sir. She arst me, sir—— Ho! Whoa!...
#ELLIS.
Good evening, Mr. Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Them candles do burn oncommon quick.... You was sayin’, Mr. Ellis?
#ELLIS.
I said good evening.
#BALDWIN.
Whoa!... Good evening to you.
#ELLIS.
It beats me what the company are up to to - night. After dinner they all went for a stroll down to the pond. ’Er ladyship wanted to see——“the great moon - flower’s reflection among the lilies.” Then they seem to ’ave separated. The old people are behaving themselves quite rational—playing bézique in the drawing - room. The others are playing the tomfool or ’ide - and - seek or something o’ the sort.
#BALDWIN.
’Iding - seek? Are they now! That minds me as ’ow I onct played ’iding - seek with Mrs. Baldwin as was my first wife—she weren’t my wife then—an’ found ’er——and found ’er——in the middle of the bed!... rose bed it wer’. “Maidens’ blush” they was, jest fur all the world same as ’er purty face. So I gives her sutting wot to blush for. That I did. Dang it! Yus, I did.
#ELLIS.
You seem to ’ave lived your life, Mr. Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
I ’ave that. I’ve ’ad thirteen, an’ two of ’em by me first wife. Thirteen’s an onlucky number I’ve ’eard tell. But I ain’t suspicious.
#ELLIS.
Su - per - stitious is what you mean, I take it?
#BALDWIN.
If I says suspicious I means it.
#ELLIS.
Well, please yourself, Mr. Baldwin, please yourself. My motter’s “Live an’ let live.” Yes, as I was saying, it’s a queer game of ’ide - and - seek they’re playing at. I saw young O’Farrel just now by the yew - trees. ’E caught sight of ’er ladyship comin’ up the path, and dived into the shadder like a frightened rabbit. Bit queer considering ’ow thick they are. I just stood aside to see if anything was going to ’appen. Then ’oo should come along but the master! They must have caught sight of each other at the same time. She gave a sorter jump an’ stood still. ’E cut and ’urried into the bushes. Then she turned and ’urried back the way she’d come. What d’yer say to that?
#BALDWIN.
What do I say?
#ELLIS.
Bit queer, ain’t it?
#BALDWIN.
Chronic! Why, a minute or two back ’er ladyship was up ’ere an’ says, “I’m looking for Mr. Cosway.” And arfter she’s gorne, ’e comes up ’ere an’ says, “I’m lookin’ for ’er ladyship,” ’e says.
#ELLIS.
Well, I give it up! There, she’s at it again! She can sing, an’ no error!
#BALDWIN.
Minds me of an ole cat as used to yeowl night after night in the rubub beds.
#ELLIS.
Good Lord, Mr. Baldwin, ’ow d’you make that out?
#BALDWIN.
Course it ain’t the same. ’Er ladyship’s voice is a rare treat to ’ear, an’ a cat’s ain’t. But there’s somethin’ in ’em both as seems to be callin’ for somethin’ else. ’Twas jest afore Mrs. Baldwin ’ad ’er seventh. An’ yer’d ’ardly b’lieve me, Mr. Ellis, that cat ’ad kittens same day as Mrs. Baldwin.
#BILL.
Ah, whisky - and - soda, Ellis. That’s good!
#ELLIS.
Yes, sir.
#BILL.
Well, Baldwin, what are you up to? Keeping an eye on the sun so as to lop off the branches?
#BALDWIN.
No, sir.... I was jest watching them lanterns.
#BILL.
Yes. They’re very pretty.
#BALDWIN.
They do burn uncommon quick.
#BILL.
Well, they’re made of paper, you know.
#BALDWIN.
Yessir.... It was the candles I was alludin’ of, sir. They do burn—— Ho!
#BILL.
Don’t give me away, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
’Iding - seek!... Whoa!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill?... Who were you talking to just now, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Mr. O’Farrel, mum.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes; I thought so—but I don’t see him.
#BALDWIN.
No, mum.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Where is he?
#BALDWIN.
’E’s gorne, m’lady.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Gone?
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m. You gave yerself away, mum, you did. D’rectly ’e ’eard your ladyship’s voice ’e was gorne, mum.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I gave myself away? Directly he heard my voice he was gone?
#BALDWIN.
’Twas like as when you come up ’ere before a - lookin’ for the master. Mr. O’Farrel, ’e was ’ere then, mum. ’E ’eard you, an’ ’e jest ran.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Mr. O’Farrel heard me and he ran?
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m. An’ if you’ll h’excuse my sayin’ so, mum, it ain’t gumptious to sing when playin’ ’iding - seek.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Playing hide - and - seek?...
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Hide - and - seek! What on earth are you talking about? I really am afraid, Baldwin, the full moon must have deprived you of your few remaining wits. Do you seriously mean to tell me that Mr. O’Farrel ran away twice because he heard me coming?
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Where did he go to?
#BALDWIN.
Beggin’ yer pardon, mum, I really couldn’t tell yer that.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You——
#BALDWIN.
I arst you, mum, would it be playin’ fair on the young gentleman?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I think you had better go home now, Baldwin. I am afraid you are not quite well. Tell Mrs. Baldwin to come and see me to - morrow.
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m.
#BALDWIN.
Whoa!
#CLARE.
S - sh!
#BALDWIN.
Lord - a - mercy!
#CLARE.
Language, Baldwin!
#BALDWIN.
Yer did give me a turn, miss.
#CLARE.
Sorry! Hullo, drinks! The coast’s clear. I’ll have some soda - water.
#BALDWIN.
’Iding - seek do give you a bit of a thirst, miss.
#CLARE.
Hide - and - seek?
#BALDWIN.
Yes, miss.
#CLARE.
Why, have you been playing hide - and - seek?
#BALDWIN.
Me, miss?
#CLARE.
Didn’t you say so just now? Really, Baldwin, for a person of your age! And now you want a drink? Well, I’ve no objection, though it looks uncommonly as if you had helped yourself already.
#BALDWIN.
Me, miss? I give you my word, miss. Why, that’s—that’s——
#MICHAEL.
Clare....
#CLARE.
Hush! Don’t say where I am!
#CLARE.
Oh!...
#BILL.
Hush!
#BALDWIN.
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!
#MICHAEL.
Wasn’t Miss Lesley speaking to you a second ago, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
She were, sir. Haw! Haw!
#MICHAEL.
Where did she go to?
#BALDWIN.
She’s gorne, sir.
#MICHAEL.
I asked you where she had gone to.
#BALDWIN.
No, sir; I couldn’t tell yer that, sir. I reely couldn’t.
#MICHAEL.
Have you been drinking, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Me, sir? Drinking? ’Pon me honour, sir, I ain’t touched a drop o’ that whisky. It’s mortal ’ard, sir, that a man o’ my years should be tole ’e’s in liquor twice in one evenin’! An’ me teetotal ’cept for me pint o’ four - ’arf at dinner an’ supper and a drop o’ somethin’ on Saturday night.
#MICHAEL.
Do you know the day of the week, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Lor’, sir, if it ain’t Sat’day.... But I give you me word, sir, I ain’t——
#MICHAEL.
Very well, Baldwin. But you must admit that your conduct was peculiar. Perhaps now you will be so good as to tell me where Miss Lesley went to.
#BALDWIN.
She—she——
#MICHAEL.
Do you mean to tell me she has climbed up the tree again?
#BALDWIN.
Maybe she ’as, sir, an’ maybe she ’asn’t. Haw! Haw!
#MICHAEL.
Fool! Clare.... Clare.... I see you, you naughty little girl.... You’ve led me a pretty dance to - night.... Clare.... If you don’t come down I’ll climb up and fetch you....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Hush!
#MICHAEL.
Oh! Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#BALDWIN.
The wrong man! Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I’m afraid he’s——
#MICHAEL.
Good God!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Don’t you think it’s better you went now, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!
#MICHAEL.
You ought to stay in bed to - morrow.
#BALDWIN.
Bed, sir?...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Or sit quietly in the sweet sunshine at your cottage door.
#BALDWIN.
Yes’m....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Good - night, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Good - night, mum. Good - night, sir.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Poor old man! I fear he is breaking up at last!
#MICHAEL.
God forgive me, dearest; I thought he had been drinking.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Let us make the twilight of his long day full of peace and fragrance.
#MICHAEL.
He shall never want.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ah, listen! Ah, listen, dear heart!
#MICHAEL.
The nightingale.
#LADY PATRICIA.
We have not far to go, you and I, to reach that land where music and moonlight and feeling are one!
#MICHAEL.
Music and moonlight and feeling——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Are one....
#MICHAEL.
Sweet bird!
#LADY PATRICIA.
But where have you been, dearest? For the last half - hour I have been looking for you down shadowy paths and by moonlit waters.
#MICHAEL.
And I for you.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Cousin Bill went indoors as he had something he wished to say to his mother. So I seized the opportunity to find you.
#MICHAEL.
Miss Lesley left me to speak to her father—and I thought I would snatch a beautiful moment with my wife.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Cousin Bill said he would come back to me in a moment.
#MICHAEL.
Miss Lesley too. I’m afraid they may be hunting for us.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Poor children! But they will forgive us when they know we have been together—and so happy. Tell me, dear, why were you looking so fixedly up the tree when I came just now? was looking for a nightingale. nightingale?...
#MICHAEL.
Yes.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I thought for a moment some one had climbed the tree, as you seemed to be speaking up into it.
#MICHAEL.
I was making fluting sounds so as to encourage the bird to sing.
#LADY PATRICIA.
How clever of you, dear! And now it’s singing in the bushes near the pond.
#MICHAEL.
Perhaps I frightened it out of the tree.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Perhaps you did.... Darling.
#MICHAEL.
Yes?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Has it ever occurred to you that child may misconstrue your beautiful friendship for her?
#MICHAEL.
Clare!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Clare?
#MICHAEL.
Er—Miss Lesley?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, Patricia, how can you think such a thing! Our friendship is like the friendship of two men or two women, the elder tenderly guiding the younger towards a higher, saner, nobler, larger view of life.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Exquisite! Ideal! But haven’t you noticed, Michael, that the child no longer accepts your companionship with the same frank pleasure as before? I have watched her lately. It seems to me as though she were always trying to avoid you.
#MICHAEL.
Avoid me! Clare!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do you call her by her Christian name?
#MICHAEL.
Only in moments of excitement. Avoid me! Impossible!
#LADY PATRICIA.
No, dear, not impossible. And when a girl pointedly avoids a man, it too often means—pursue me.
#MICHAEL.
Ah!... Ah! yes. But I think you must be mistaken.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Indeed, I hope so. But you must be careful. You are so attractive, Michael.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, nonsense, darling!... Strangely enough, a week or two ago I was on the point of warning you in just the same way.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Warning me?
#MICHAEL.
I used to watch that boy’s eyes when he looked at you. They were the eyes of a loving spaniel.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Cousin Bill’s?
#MICHAEL.
Yes; and I felt sorry for him. But I think his infatuation was only temporary.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Temporary? What do you mean?
#MICHAEL.
He no longer sits at your feet and follows you about as much as he used to.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You are quite wrong. His cousinly affection is the same now as it ever was. He was never in any way infatuated.
#MICHAEL.
How could he help it, dearest? You are so wonderful!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Am I? I wonder! I think we really ought to join the others now, dearest.
#MICHAEL.
Very well.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What is it, dear? was looking for a star.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Which star?
#MICHAEL.
Arcturus.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But Arcturus is low in the west.
#MICHAEL.
How stupid of me!
#BALDWIN.
It’s all right, sir. It’s all right, miss. They’ve gorne. They’ve gorne.... It’s all right, sir. They’ve gorne. They’ve gorne....
#BILL.
What the devil d’you want, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Beg pardon, sir?
#BILL.
What do you want?
#BALDWIN.
They’ve gorne, sir.
#BILL.
I can’t help that, can I?
#BALDWIN.
No, sir.
#BILL.
Well, then?
#BALDWIN.
You see, sir, it’s like this. I thought as ’ow——
#CLARE.
Oh, Baldwin, for the love of heaven, hook it!
#BALDWIN.
’Ook it?
#CLARE.
Yes; run away, like a dear.
#BALDWIN.
Very good, miss.
#BILL.
Darling.
#CLARE.
You’ve pulled all my hair down——
#BILL.
Oh, I——
#CLARE.
I’ve lost at least six hair - pins. You needn’t have been so rough.
#BILL.
I’m awfully sorry, darling—but——
#CLARE.
No, stay where you are....
#BILL.
Darling——
#CLARE.
Don’t touch me....
#BILL.
Clare!...
#CLARE.
Please find those hair - pins, and the two side - combs. They’re all real tortoise - shell.
#BILL.
But I say——
#CLARE.
Find those hair - pins, or, at any rate, the side - combs.
#BILL.
Oh, all right....
#BILL.
Here are a couple.... By Jove! one of ’em’s got rammed tight behind the seat.... Another—that’s three.... Four!... I’ve found one of the side - combs.... I say, they are jolly pretty!... Where the deuce has t’other one got to?... Oh, Lord, I’m awfully sorry! It’s smashed. I put my clumsy hoof on it....
#CLARE.
It’s all right....
#BILL.
But—— I say, darling, is anything the matter with you? A moment ago——
#CLARE.
You must never call me that again.
#BILL.
Call you what?
#CLARE.
“Darling.”
#BILL.
But——
#CLARE.
Or put your arm round me....
#BILL.
But——
#CLARE.
Oh, Bill, I was mad—I lost my head—I forgot.... It was so—so thrilling in there.... I should never have let you—I should never have let you....
#BILL.
But I—I only kissed you.
#CLARE.
You—you——
#BILL.
And told you that I loved you.
#CLARE.
Yes....
#BILL.
And you said you loved me....
#CLARE.
I didn’t!
#BILL.
You kissed me.
#CLARE.
That’s not the same thing.
#BILL.
Then you don’t love me?
#CLARE.
I never said so.
#BILL.
Do you love me, Clare?
#CLARE.
I should never have kissed you if I didn’t.
#BILL.
Clare!
#CLARE.
No....
#BILL.
No?...
#CLARE.
I am not free.
#BILL.
Not ... free.... Then you’re—you’re—engaged?
#CLARE.
No.
#BILL.
No?... But——
#CLARE.
I am not free.
#BILL.
But you’re not engaged?
#CLARE.
No.
#BILL.
Clare! You don’t mean—you can’t mean that you are married?...
#CLARE.
Married?
#BILL.
Yes—married!
#CLARE.
Don’t be silly.
#BILL.
That’s no answer. Are you married?
#CLARE.
Of course I’m not.
#BILL.
You’re neither engaged nor married—but you’re not free to marry me. What does it all mean?
#CLARE.
You must be content with that.
#BILL.
Must I? Then you don’t know me. I’ll give you no rest—I’ll persecute you night and day till I get at the truth.
#CLARE.
You may be right, Bill; perhaps I do owe you an explanation since I allowed you to kiss me....
#BILL.
And kissed me....
#CLARE.
I belong to another man....
#BILL.
But you said just now——
#CLARE.
Whom I can never marry....
#BILL.
What!
#CLARE.
Because he is already married.
#BILL.
Clare! you—you——
#CLARE.
Our bond is purely of the spirit.
#BILL.
Eh?
#CLARE.
He is a noble and high - souled gentleman. His life is one long self - sacrifice for the woman whom he married. She loves him, and for her sake he fought against his love for me. But that love mastered him: he confessed it. I told him it was returned, though I know now it was the pity and friendship I felt for him which I mistook for love. We promised to be true to each other. I cannot—I dare not break my promise. My love is all he has to make life bearable....
#BILL.
Great—Scott!
#CLARE.
I beg your pardon?
#BILL.
I say, Clare, d’you know I’ve made an ass of myself in just the same way as you!
#CLARE.
An ass?... Will you kindly explain yourself.
#BILL.
I had no right to tell you I loved you, because I am bound to another woman.
#CLARE.
Not—not to a married woman? married woman....
#CLARE.
Oh, how dreadful!
#BILL.
Our bond is purely of the spirit.
#CLARE.
Oh?... What is she like?
#BILL.
Noble and high - souled like your——
#CLARE.
Is she pretty?
#BILL.
Oh, yes, she——
#CLARE.
Did you love her?
#BILL.
Till I met you five weeks ago I believe I did. Then I—— Anyhow, I’m afraid I’ll have to stick to her. If I threw her over now I don’t know what the poor woman would do.
#CLARE.
You have a pretty high notion of your attractions.
#BILL.
And you of yours.
#CLARE.
You appear to forget that I am a woman. She’s coming here!...
#CLARE.
Well?... Bill—you don’t mean to say that she—— That’s he!
#BILL.
That’s Michael.... Good God! Clare, it’s not—it’s not Michael that you——
#CLARE.
Hush!... They’re going past....
#BILL.
The blackguard!
#CLARE.
What do you mean?
#BILL.
If I hadn’t been a blind fool, I would have seen through this precious friendship for you long ago. It never dawned on me that the fellow was such a scoundrel. And a precious hypocrite, too, by Jove! Playing up so as to make that poor, trusting woman believe him madly in love with her....
#CLARE.
That poor, trusting woman? Are you, by any chance, speaking of Patricia?
#BILL.
Of course I am. Hanging about her neck while all the time he’s making love to an innocent girl! It’s perfectly disgusting!
#CLARE.
And what has your noble, high - souled Patricia been doing, I should like to know? Shamming infatuation for poor Michael to hide her shameful flirtation with a callow boy.
#BILL.
It was not a shameful flirtation—and I’m no more a callow boy than you are.
#CLARE.
What amazes me is that you should ever have allowed yourself to be fooled by a shallow, deceitful poseuse like Patricia.
#BILL.
She hasn’t fooled me. She’s deeply and truly in love with me.
#CLARE.
Contradiction isn’t argument: it’s merely rude.
#BILL.
If it had been any one else but Michael there might have been some excuse for you. But Michael! How could you? A dull, priggish ass——
#CLARE.
He’s not a dull, priggish ass!
#BILL.
Contradiction isn’t argument: it’s merely rude.
#CLARE.
How dare you speak to me like that!
#BILL.
I beg your pardon.
#CLARE.
I don’t think there’s anything more to be said.
#BILL.
Neither do I.
#CLARE.
Nothing.
#BILL.
Nothing.
#CLARE.
Things must remain as they are.
#BILL.
Yes, I suppose they must.
#CLARE.
Of course, any one who was at all unprejudiced would see at once the—the higher morality of my decision.
#BILL.
The what?
#CLARE.
The higher morality. Michael has often told me that our pure love and the fact that he does his duty as best he can to his wife are the only things that keep him from suicide....
#BILL.
Bosh!
#CLARE.
I beg your pardon?
#BILL.
Nothing.... It’s awfully funny to think of Michael spooning away with you and Patricia and boring you both to death without knowing it.
#CLARE.
I don’t see that it’s any funnier than Patricia doing the same with you and Michael.
#BILL.
Well, anyhow, I shall have to stick to Patricia—not because of “higher morality”—whatever that means—but because I know she would pine away if I left her now.
#CLARE.
Tchah!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, I find it chilly, Dean—distinctly chilly.
#DEAN.
For Whitsuntide, dear lady—surely not. True, Whitsuntide is very late this year....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Why, here’s the child! All alone, my dear? Whatever have you been doing to your hair?
#CLARE.
It’s such a hot night I had to take it down.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Hot?
#DEAN.
But, my dear child, you can’t possibly go home like that!
#CLARE.
I’ll put it up when I get back to the house.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Is that my son?
#BILL.
Hullo, mater....
#DEAN.
Enchanting night, my boy!
#BILL.
Awfully jolly....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And where are the others?
#CLARE.
I don’t know.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Sentimentalising in the moonlight....
#CLARE.
I suppose so.
#DEAN.
And what have you two been up to?
#BILL.
Mootching around.
#CLARE.
Playing about.
#DEAN.
Your mother and I thought we’d like a little stroll before going home.
#BILL.
Good idea....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What’s the matter with you both?
#BILL AND CLARE.
The matter?...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Have you been quarrelling?
#BILL AND CLARE.
Quarrelling?...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
You’re as sulky as two bears.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
As two bears. Aren’t they, Dean?
#DEAN.
Sulky? No, no; surely not sulky! Chastened! Thoughtful! A little overcome, perhaps, by the beauty of the night—as all sensitive young souls should be.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
H’m!... Sensitive young souls!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
All of you? But how charming! How delightful!
#DEAN.
Dear Lady Patricia!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What have you been doing with yourselves?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Looking at the guelder - roses in the moonlight, and wondering whether they were guelder - roses at all or great pearls.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Personally I should say they were guelder - roses.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ah, but dear Aunt Eileen, how can you tell what pranks the fairies may not play on such a night as this?
#DEAN.
What an exquisite fancy!
#BILL.
I say, Cousin Patricia....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, Cousin Bill?
#BILL.
If it wouldn’t bother you too much, I wonder if you’d care to take me to have a look at those thingumybob roses. It would be simply corking!
#LADY PATRICIA.
I shall be charmed, Cousin Bill. We’ll settle the question of guelder - rose or pearl together.
#CLARE.
Worm! Mr. Cosway, you’ve never shown me the—the what’s - its - name....
#MICHAEL.
The spiral nebula in Andromeda? It’s scarcely favourable for a view of the nebula to - night. Shall we look at the mountains of the moon?
#CLARE.
Thanks awfully.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do you believe in fairies, Cousin Bill?
#MICHAEL.
I have often wondered how the night would look if we had nine moons like Jupiter.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
H’m....
#DEAN.
I beg your pardon?... You were saying?...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I didn’t say anything. I was thinking.
#DEAN.
Ah, thinking—yes, thinking.... So was I.... By the way, Eileen, your—er—cherished project for marrying Clare to your son doesn’t appear to be materialising quite—er—satisfactorily.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No, it doesn’t.
#DEAN.
Not quite as smoothly as we—as you hoped.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Give me a whisky - and - soda. whisky——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And soda. Go on.... Nearly full.... When!... And you had better take something as well—to fortify yourself against what I am going to say.
#DEAN.
Ah.... A little soda - water. So you are going to be unpleasant, my dear Eileen?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I am. Those two had been quarrelling just now.
#DEAN.
That was evident—even to me.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
They had been quarrelling bitterly—and I can make a shrewd guess at the cause.
#DEAN.
I also.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Indeed. Well, I think it’s high time to speak plainly.
#DEAN.
I quite agree with you.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I’m glad to hear it.... Bill had very evidently been taking your daughter to task for her amazing indiscretions.
#DEAN.
Amazing indiscretions? Clare’s? Will you kindly be more explicit.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I mean to be. Perhaps you remember some weeks ago I warned you that her intimacy with Michael Cosway ought to be stopped?
#DEAN.
Certainly. And I took leave to disagree with you entirely.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, you were wrong. You should immediately have put an end to this intimacy—to use the mildest word for her friendship with Michael.
#DEAN.
Mrs. O’Farrel, is it possible you are speaking of my daughter?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And it’s your duty to put an end to it at once. I only hope that you may not be too late.
#DEAN.
This—this—this is beyond anything!... Perhaps you will be so good——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Now then, Dean, pray don’t lose your temper. It’s neither wise nor becoming, and at our age very bad for the heart. Listen to me quietly for a moment. I refused for a long time to believe any ill of this—er—friendship. I knew Michael to be infatuated with his wife, and Clare to be a healthy - minded girl. But last week Emily Fitzgerald told me she had seen Michael walking in the Stanton Woods with his arm around Clare’s shoulder. She added that the affair was becoming quite notorious in the neighbourhood.... You must act, and act at once.
#DEAN.
Is that all? So you condescend to listen to the tittle - tattle of a notorious old gossip like Emily Fitzgerald? Upon my word I’m ashamed of you!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Dean! Have you taken leave of your senses?
#DEAN.
I might well put that question to you, Mrs. O’Farrel. But I refrain from vulgar tu quoque repartee. I have no more to say except to warn you that before looking after the morals of my daughter, you had far better look after those of your son.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
My son?
#DEAN.
Precisely—your son.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What do you mean?
#DEAN.
I and others—unlike yourself, I will not drag in the names of outsiders—have for some time past watched your son and Lady Patricia with grief and dismay.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Patricia!
#DEAN.
Just now you believed your son had been impertinently taking Clare to task for her charming friendship with Michael Cosway. I am convinced you were mistaken. It was Clare who had been warning your son that his indiscretions were becoming the talk of the place.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Bill entangled with Patricia! And Clare—Clare preaching propriety! It’s too laughable! A boy’s innocent homage for a woman at least ten years his senior! You’re a very foolish old man.
#DEAN.
Again I put away from me the tu quoque retort.... Add two and two together. I don’t for a moment blame her. I can’t find it in my heart to blame her. The dear and beautiful creature is as God made her: exquisitely sensitive, sentimental and infinitely affectionate.... But I warn you, Mrs. O’Farrel, I warn you.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I refuse to hear another word. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!... And the saddest part of the whole affair is my poor boy’s undoubted affection for your daughter.
#DEAN.
Affection for Clare! I don’t believe it!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Are you his mother?
#DEAN.
Certainly not!... But I have watched him—with the result that I am convinced of his infatuation for Lady Patricia.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fiddle - sticks!
#DEAN.
And I may as well tell you, though you will not believe it, that my poor girl’s affections are centred on your son.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh, dam’ foolishness!
#DEAN.
This has gone far enough, Mrs. O’Farrel.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Quite far enough. I am going home.
#DEAN.
So am I. Eileen!...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What is it?
#DEAN.
Hush!... Clare’s coming here with Michael Cosway. I offer you a chance to substantiate the aspersions you have made against her character.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What do you mean?
#DEAN.
We will conceal ourselves in the summer - house and hear what they have to say to each other.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Really, Dean!
#DEAN.
We may disregard the rules of ordinary morality in a situation like this. I speak professionally. Quick!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, upon my word!...
#CLARE.
Father!... Why, they’ve gone!...
#MICHAEL.
They must have returned to the house.
#CLARE.
We had better go too.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, Clare, a moment.... Look at me, dear....
#CLARE.
Well?
#MICHAEL.
Are you unhappy?
#CLARE.
Why should I be?
#MICHAEL.
You are no longer the wild and buoyant thing you were. You have grown so pensive and distrait. And is it my jealous imagination?—so often lately you have seemed to avoid me....
#CLARE.
I—I’m sorry....
#MICHAEL.
There’s trouble in your eyes, my dearest. Clare, do you chafe at the restrictions fate has put on our love?
#CLARE.
Oh, I—I don’t know. I’m all right, Michael—but you—— We’d better go in now. Father’s waiting for me.
#MICHAEL.
Clare.
#CLARE.
Yes.
#MICHAEL.
Kiss me before you go.
#CLARE.
Oh, not now....
#MICHAEL.
Kiss me, dear. How sweet it is!...
#CLARE.
Sweet?
#MICHAEL.
Your “pigtail,” dear. The sight of it makes me feel a boy again. I should like to pull it and run away.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Ah, the nightingale! How charmingly it sings to - night!... I do wish we had some nightingales at Ashurst. I suppose they prefer low - lying ground like this.... Do they sing in your garden at the Deanery?
#DEAN.
Eileen——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Yes?
#DEAN.
This is dreadful—dreadful....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
On the contrary, I think it’s most delightful! One can hear every note so perfectly at this elevation.
#DEAN.
Is it generous of you—is it generous of you, Eileen, to flaunt your terrible triumph like this? I am heart - broken! I am distracted! What on earth am I to do?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Drink this!
#DEAN.
I don’t care for whisky.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh, you needn’t make such a fuss! It’s perfectly obvious from what we saw just now that no real harm has been done. The way she kissed Michael——
#DEAN.
How can you, Eileen? How can you?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
It reminded me of a child taking castor - oil!... But Michael—the double - faced hypocrisy of the man! I’m really very sorry for Patricia.
#DEAN.
I don’t see the necessity for lavishing sympathy on her.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What do you mean? Doesn’t she believe he returns her devotion?
#DEAN.
Her devotion doesn’t prevent her philandering with other men, as I told you just now.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, upon my word! I wouldn’t have believed it! In spite of this gross example of your obtuseness, you still have the—the audacity to stick to your slander against Bill! Really I—— We must hide in the summer - house....
#DEAN.
Eh? What?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
At once! Bill and Patricia are returning here. You will see for yourself there’s nothing more between them than cousinly regard.
#DEAN.
I refuse to eavesdrop a lady.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
But you deliberately did it a moment ago.
#DEAN.
Clare is my daughter.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fiddlesticks! Quick now!
#DEAN.
I submit——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Hush!
#DEAN.
—Under protest....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Cousin Bill and I have discovered that guelder - roses are guelder - roses after all.... Why, Bill dear, they’re not here!
#BILL.
Got impatient, I suppose, and went back to the house. About time we did the same. It’s getting late.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Too late, too late! Ye cannot enter now!
#BILL.
What d’you say?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I was quoting Tennyson.
#BILL.
Oh....
#LADY PATRICIA.
You know the lines, don’t you? Listen: Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill! Late, late, so late, but we can enter still! Too late, too late! Ye cannot enter now! So sweet and sad, are they not? Don’t you love sweet, sad things?
#BILL.
Rather.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
#BILL.
Rather.... I say, hadn’t we better be going?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill....
#BILL.
Yes.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do you love me as you used to?
#BILL.
I say, why d’you—you don’t think——
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no—no—ah, no! I know well enough that your love is deeper and stronger than it was. But this sacred love—this hopeless love of ours has swept you suddenly into manhood. You are no longer a boy; you are graver; you are sadder.... And if sometimes you seem to avoid me now, it’s due to no cooling of passion, but to the fear lest the pent - up lava at your heart should overflow and ruin us both.
#BILL.
I say, you do put things awfully well!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Petrarch and Laura—Paolo and Francesca—Lancelot and Guinevere.... Bill—no, William and Patricia.... Ah, my poor boy, put your arm around me, and say those lines of Lovelace that I taught you.
#BILL.
Oh, I say—really, you know—— On my honour, I’ve forgotten ’em....
#LADY PATRICIA.
No, no! You’re merely shy—bashful—boyish! I love to hear you say that verse. Yet this——
#BILL.
Yet this—yet this—— What’s the word?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yet this inconstancy——
#BILL.
Yet this inconstancy is such I could not love thee, dear, so much,
#LADY PATRICIA.
Loved I not honour more.... Love—duty—honour—— Come, dear....
#DEAN.
H’m.... Cousinly regard!...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
It’s shocking! Outrageous!
#DEAN.
It is indeed.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
—That you shouldn’t even pretend to hide your satisfaction at the scene we have just witnessed.
#DEAN.
Satisfaction! I assure you, dear lady, I’m shocked and grieved—deeply grieved, that your son should prove capable of such depravity.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
My son! You know as well as I do that the foolish boy has been bewitched by that unprincipled woman.
#DEAN.
Come, come, Eileen. In common fairness we should apportion the blame equally—though, indeed, my experience has generally led me to the conclusion that the man is more to blame in these cases than the woman.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Your experience! Quite so!... I shall give Patricia my plain, unvarnished opinion of herself and forbid her my house. You will tell Michael that he’s a scoundrel and a libertine.
#DEAN.
No, no, no! Tact, tact, my dear Eileen, tact and diplomacy!... Let us calmly review the position. Cosway’s and Lady Patricia’s relations with Clare and your son, though highly culpable, appear to be blameless of the worst, and considerably more—er—ardent on the part of the married couple than of the single. So much is—er—unhappily evident. Now, do you still maintain that your son is—er—interested in Clare?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I am certain of it.
#DEAN.
Incredible! Of course, I know—in spite of appearances—that Clare feels strongly for your son.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fudge!
#DEAN.
Now, my dear Eileen, pray don’t fall back on contradiction. What we have both got to do is to bring these young people together——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Hush! D’you hear? All four of them! Of course, they went up to the house to look for us.... What shall we do?
#DEAN.
Ah! Allow me.... Clare....
#CLARE.
Hullo!...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
But are you going to let them know——
#DEAN.
I beg you, Eileen, to sit down and control yourself.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well, but I should like to know——
#DEAN.
Will you kindly entrust the conduct of the situation entirely to me. Take your cue from me, and above all, be tactful and dignified.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I really believe you are thoroughly enjoying yourself.
#DEAN.
Pray don’t be flippant, Eileen. This is a very serious matter.
#CLARE.
We thought you had gone back to the house.
#DEAN.
Indeed.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I really believe they went to depreciate the guelder - roses as well!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
We did nothing of the sort, Patricia, and let——
#DEAN.
Kindly allow me, Mrs. O’Farrel.... No, Lady Patricia, we have not been to examine the guelder - roses. We have been all the time here. PATRICIA, BILL, MICHAEL, CLARE. Here!...
#DEAN.
We have been all the time—here.
#MICHAEL.
But—but I returned a short while ago, and you were certainly not here then.
#DEAN.
Excuse me, sir—we were.
#CLARE.
But we never saw you....
#DEAN.
That I can quite believe. We, however, saw you and Mr. Cosway quite distinctly.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Most distinctly! And I——
#DEAN.
Allow me, Mrs. O’Farrel....
#BILL.
But, I say——
#DEAN.
Sir?
#BILL.
You can’t have been here a minute or two ago when Patri—— Cousin Patricia and I——
#DEAN.
Pardon me, sir—we were.
#BILL.
But, I say, you must have hidden yourselves somewhere, because——
#DEAN.
Your mother and I were sitting in the summer - house. BILL, CLARE. Oh ...!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Oh!... O—oh!...
#MICHAEL.
What—what is the matter, dear?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Nothing.... I—I am a little faint——
#MICHAEL.
The—the night is certainly oppressive....
#LADY PATRICIA.
I—I’m all right now....
#DEAN.
I think it is high time to go.... Did you see whether the carriage had arrived?
#CLARE.
Yes, it’s there.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Come, Bill, we must be getting home.
#DEAN.
I have several weighty additions to make to my sermon to - morrow—additions which certain events to - night have suggested. I trust you will all be at the Cathedral for morning service. Mrs. O’Farrel.... Clare.... The nightingale sings most divinely to - night!
#BALDWIN.
If you please, sir....
#MICHAEL.
What is it, Baldwin? What is it?
#BALDWIN.
If you please, sir, will you be using them lanterns agin to - night?
#MICHAEL.
No.
#BALDWIN.
Then I ’ad better take ’em down, sir?
#MICHAEL.
Yes, take them down. Come, dear.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, darling.
#BALDWIN.
Whoa!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Will you love me, Michael, always—always—and no matter what may happen?
#MICHAEL.
I? How can you ask? But you—could you still love me if—if——
#LADY PATRICIA.
If——?
#MICHAEL.
If I were unworthy?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You!
#BALDWIN.
Whoa!... Whoa!... Whoa!...
#DEAN.
What a morning! Fragrant! Exquisite! Ha! A happy Whitsun, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you, sir. Same to you, sir.
#DEAN.
Eh?... Oh, certainly!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir. It’s mornings like this, sir, that one feels a inclination to sing the tedium.
#DEAN.
To sing the—er——?
#JOHN GALE.
The tedium, sir.
#DEAN.
The Te Deum! Ah, yes, to be sure! To sing the Te Deum. Most appropriate! A quarter to ten.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir. It’s highly significant to see so many people at early service this morning, sir. Highly significant.
#DEAN.
Ah, yes!... Is Miss Clare in the garden?
#JOHN GALE.
I believe she is, sir.
#DEAN.
Well, she’ll be here in a minute. I think, as it’s rather late, I had better begin at once. Is this all you’re giving me to - day, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, no, sir. There’s an omelette with asparagus - tops to come.
#DEAN.
Good. Very good! In the meantime these delicious fruits.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir. If you please, sir, Mr. Cosway’s gardener was here this morning before you came back from church. As far as I could gather he had some message from her ladyship which he refused to leave. I gathered he had instructions to give it to you direct, sir.
#DEAN.
Oh ... ah ... h’m.... Is he here now?
#JOHN GALE.
No, sir; I told him to come back at ten o’clock. He’s gone to the cemetery to visit the grave of his first wife.
#DEAN.
Bring him here when he comes.
#JOHN GALE.
Very good, sir.
#CLARE.
Good morning, father.
#DEAN.
Good morning, Clare. May! Is it for me?
#CLARE.
You can have it if you like.
#DEAN.
Thank you, my dear. Fragrant, delicately - tinted, fresh and dewy as young girls. But you don’t look quite yourself, my child. little tired. Perhaps you slept badly?
#CLARE.
I’m as fit as a fiddle, and I slept like a log.
#DEAN.
These peaches are delicious. Try one.
#CLARE.
Aren’t there any cherries yet?
#DEAN.
I’m afraid not. “Fruits in due season,” you know, my dear!
#CLARE.
What about your peaches?
#DEAN.
That’s different, quite different. An early peach cannot be too early. They live in glass houses——
#CLARE.
And don’t throw their stones.... I’ll have a cup of tea.
#DEAN.
There’s an omelette with asparagus - tops on the way.
#CLARE.
I’m not hungry.
#DEAN.
Oh, that’s a pity! I suppose it’s this exceptionally early summer.
#CLARE.
Yes. I was unbearably hot all night. And so thirsty that I drank nearly all the water in my jug.
#DEAN.
Dear me! Wasn’t there any in the carafe?
#CLARE.
I drank that as well.
#DEAN.
Really? It seems to me that for a log you were somewhat restive last night. log?
#DEAN.
I thought you slept like a log.
#CLARE.
I scarcely slept a wink.
#DEAN.
Well, well, my dear, so long as you feel—to use your expression—as fit as a fiddle, it——
#CLARE.
I feel rotten.
#DEAN.
I’m sorry. I didn’t go to bed until very late myself. Those little additions to my sermon took me longer than I had anticipated. This looks most inviting. And as there doesn’t seem to be much of it, I’m not, on the whole, sorry that you’ve lost your appetite this morning! It’s an ill wind that——
#CLARE.
May I have some, please?
#DEAN.
Changeable young person!
#CLARE.
Well, of course, if you grudge me a little piece of your omelette——
#DEAN.
Not at all, my dear! Not at all!
#CLARE.
You needn’t give me three - quarters of it.
#DEAN.
Very well. You had better take the other piece, then.
#CLARE.
Oh, it doesn’t matter!
#DEAN.
I don’t mind confessing that I’m very hungry, so unless you really want it, my dear——
#CLARE.
Oh, for goodness’ sake, father, take the whole lot! I’m sure I don’t want to deprive you of your food!
#DEAN.
What a peppery young lady it is! I was only joking.
#CLARE.
I may be sadly lacking in humour, but jokes about omelettes and the condition of one’s stomach never much appealed to me.
#DEAN.
Really, my dear child, I should much prefer your not using that word.
#CLARE.
Stomach?
#DEAN.
Yes.
#CLARE.
Oh! I do hope you’re not going to suggest I should say “Little Mary”!
#DEAN.
Little Mary? I—er—don’t quite see the connection.... Is there any reason for alluding to that—er—portion of the anatomy?
#CLARE.
I was under the impression that you made the first allusion to it.
#DEAN.
My dear, I merely mentioned the fact that I was hungry.
#CLARE.
Well, you’re not hungry with your foot, are you?
#DEAN.
Don’t you think this bickering rather silly and childish?
#CLARE.
Very.
#DEAN.
Unclouded sunshine and a sense of deep peace and repose! My ideal of an English Sunday! John told me just now that he feels inclined to sing the Te Deum on mornings like this.
#CLARE.
Why don’t you come to the point, father?
#DEAN.
The point?...
#CLARE.
Yes.
#DEAN.
I don’t quite understand.
#CLARE.
I think you owe me some explanation of your extraordinary action last night.
#DEAN.
My extraordinary action!...
#CLARE.
Yes—in deliberately hiding yourself in the summer - house to overhear a private conversation.
#DEAN.
You amaze me, Clare! Instead of being grateful for my silence on the events of yesterday, you turn on me as though you had a grievance! My action was amply justified by the circumstances.
#CLARE.
I don’t see how eavesdropping can ever be justified. And now you’re bent on giving us “beans” from the pulpit. I’m awfully sorry to have to say it, father, but really it’s rotten bad form....
#DEAN.
We won’t discuss the matter any further. Believe me, I am the best judge of my actions.
#CLARE.
And I of mine.
#DEAN.
You refer to the unhappy discoveries Mrs. O’Farrel and I made last night?
#CLARE.
I do.
#DEAN.
Certainly, if you’re heartily ashamed of yourself, you’re a competent judge of your actions.
#CLARE.
I’m not in the least ashamed of myself.
#DEAN.
Then, my dear child——
#CLARE.
And why should I be? I’ve done nothing wrong.
#DEAN.
You have done very wrong indeed. But I don’t wish to exaggerate. Of course, I know this has been nothing more than a foolish flirtation. Reprehensible—most reprehensible. A grave error, but scarcely a sin. We will say no more about it.... One thing, however, I am bound to insist upon after what came to my knowledge last night. You must have nothing more to do with that young man.
#CLARE.
What young man? Michael’s forty, if he’s a day.
#DEAN.
I was not speaking of Mr. Cosway. Honestly, your future relations with him don’t cause me acute anxiety. I was alluding to young O’Farrel.
#CLARE.
Bill!
#DEAN.
I think, my dear, we will leave the use of his Christian name to the unhappy lady—or ladies—with whom he is intimate. Certain facts have come to my knowledge. He is not a fit companion for a young girl. Your acquaintance with him must cease from to - day.
#CLARE.
Oh!... And may I ask what he has done?
#DEAN.
It is quite superfluous to go into—er—unsavoury details.
#CLARE.
You seriously expect me to cut him because he doesn’t quite meet with your approval?
#DEAN.
I expect you to obey me implicitly.
#CLARE.
I had better tell you at once, father, that I shall do nothing of the kind.
#DEAN.
Clare! You forget yourself!
#CLARE.
His crime hasn’t by chance anything to do with Patricia?
#DEAN.
H’m—well, since you appear to know something about this, it would be—er—affectation on my part to deny it. His conduct has been shameful, outrageous, and ungentlemanly.
#CLARE.
His conduct has been splendid. That detestable creature got hold of him somehow, and he behaved perfectly from start to finish. Of course you side with her because you think her pretty. But——
#DEAN.
We won’t discuss the matter any further, my child. You are very young and headstrong and inexperienced, and must learn to repose implicit faith in your father’s judgment. You are not to see this young man again.
#CLARE.
I’m sorry, father, but I refuse to obey you.
#DEAN.
Clare!
#CLARE.
It’s grossly unjust—it’s mean and horrid. I won’t do such a caddish thing even for you. I am going to see him now.
#DEAN.
Clare, remember I have forbidden it.
#CLARE.
I don’t care! I’m going to him now! I won’t go to church to be preached at. I’m going to him. You can turn me out of your house, if you like, father. But I won’t obey you. I won’t.
#DEAN.
Clare, how dare you! Oh! Most satisfactory.
#JOHN GALE.
Mr. Cosway’s gardener has just called again, sir.
#DEAN.
Very well. Bring him round.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir.
#JOHN GALE.
Mr. Baldwin, sir.
#DEAN.
Ah.... Good morning, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Mornin’, sir.
#DEAN.
You have a message for me from her ladyship?
#BALDWIN.
Yessir. I would ’a lef’ this at the door, sir, without troublin’ you, but ’er ladyship when she give it me said most particular as I was to ’and it to you personal, sir.
#DEAN.
Quite so. Quite so.
#BALDWIN.
And ’ere’s the other letter, sir.
#DEAN.
Eh, what? Another?
#BALDWIN.
Yessir. As I was leavin’ ’ome, the master come up and give it me, and said most particular as I was to ’and it to you personal.
#DEAN.
Oh.... Er—thank you.... I understand you’ve been to visit the grave of the late Mrs. Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
I ’ave that, sir. She was a good wife to me, sir, though she did give me ondly two.... I’ve ’ad thirteen, sir, an’ two of ’em by ’er.
#DEAN.
Thirteen! Excellent! Excellent!
#BALDWIN.
Yessir. Thirteen’s an onlucky number, I’ve ’eard tell, but I ain’t suspicious.
#DEAN.
And how many of the thirteen are girls, Baldwin?
#BALDWIN.
Nine of ’em, sir—leastways, I think as ’ow nine of ’em is female. H’Annie, and H’Effel, ’Enrietta, Louisa, Maggie, Victoria ... H’Alice.... H’Edith.... an’—an’ Milly. Yessir—nine. The rest is boys.
#DEAN.
Nine! Dear me! What a terrible responsibility. Their upbringing must have been very trying. Nine!
#BALDWIN.
Yessir. They do give a bit more worry than boys. But Mrs. Baldwin’s a rare ’and at tacklin’ ’er own sects.
#DEAN.
Oh, really? And what measures did she take when they were fractious and disobedient?
#BALDWIN.
She ’anded ’em over to me, sir.
#DEAN.
And what did you do?
#BALDWIN.
I thrashed ’em.
#DEAN.
Did you really! That never dawned on me as a practical measure.... I wonder—I wonder whether all girls would derive benefit from—er—occasional chastisement.
#BALDWIN.
You take my word for it, sir. All my girls ’ave gorne straight and married respec’able.
#DEAN.
Gone straight and married respectably! All nine of them!... And do you put down this happy result to your special treatment?
#BALDWIN.
Yessir.
#DEAN.
Most interesting! Most interesting! I must think it over—I must indeed....
#JOHN GALE.
Mrs. O’Farrel has called, sir.
#DEAN.
Oh.... Ask her out here, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Very good, sir.
#DEAN.
Ah, Baldwin—yes.... What was I saying?
#BALDWIN.
You said as you’d think it over, sir.
#DEAN.
Oh, to be sure! Physical chastisement for girls. Quite so.
#JOHN GALE.
Mrs. O’Farrel.
#DEAN.
My dear Eileen! This is a most unexpected pleasure!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Nonsense. You guessed I should turn up.
#DEAN.
Well, I may have hoped it.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Good morning, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Mornin’, ma’am.
#DEAN.
Baldwin has been giving me sage advice on the up - bringing of girls.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
You need it.
#DEAN.
He’s a great advocate of—er—corporal punishment.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh!... That’s all very well when they’re in short frocks, Baldwin. But afterwards, I don’t exactly see how——
#DEAN.
Quite so....
#BALDWIN.
I thrashed Milly when she was turned twenty, mum.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Upon my word! What on earth had the girl done?
#BALDWIN.
Mrs. Baldwin found ’er sittin ’on Constable ’Iggins’ knee—’e was a married man, as you may remember, sir, and ’e——
#DEAN.
Yes, yes, yes, Baldwin.... Neither of these notes requires an answer, thank you. Good morning.
#BALDWIN.
Mornin’, sir. Mornin’, ma’am.
#DEAN.
Well?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well?...
#DEAN.
I said it first.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And I’m a woman.
#DEAN.
True. To begin with I’ve just received these two notes.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
From Patricia!... Now I really wonder whether this terribly agitated handwriting is put on.
#DEAN.
Be generous, Eileen!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
What on earth does the woman mean by scrawling “Sunrise” on the top of the page?
#DEAN.
Presumably that was when she wrote the letter.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh, I see! She wants you to believe she paced her room in wakeful agony all night. “Sunrise. I have need of confession. I will call at the Deanery before morning service—PATRICIA COSWAY.” Confession! Evidently she means to enjoy herself!... “DEAR DEAN,—I am calling on you before morning service to - day. I trust, in spite of all that has happened, you will not refuse to receive me—MICHAEL COSWAY.” Very interesting. What do you intend to do?
#DEAN.
Honestly, I haven’t made up my mind yet.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I protest against your giving Patricia and yourself the luxury of private confession. She owes me her precious confession, not you. Have her out here, and we’ll trounce her together.
#DEAN.
Poor woman!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fiddle - de - dee! She’s having the time of her life. I wonder whether they’ve confessed to each other.
#DEAN.
I shouldn’t think so—but I mean that they shall.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
So do I.... Well, Dean, I’ve had it out with my son.
#DEAN.
Ah....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Driving home last night I talked about the likelihood of a thunderstorm, Crême de Menthe and lawn - tennis, and made him thoroughly uncomfortable.
#DEAN.
Then you said nothing about——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Not a word. And we both went to bed. He came down to breakfast in a shocking temper. I cheerfully exhausted two tedious subjects: the House of Lords and domestic servants. Suddenly he lost his manners—cut me short—and plunged into the sad story of Patricia and himself.... Now, I’d had time to think the matter over! I treated the whole thing as a youthful peccadillo and mildly suggested he had better put an end to it. The poor dear boy was completely floored. I’m sure he’d prepared himself against a regular tornado. He simply sat there and stared at me.... Then abruptly I turned the conversation on to your daughter.
#DEAN.
Eh?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I described her conduct as scandalous, herself as a hussy, and wound up with a burst of gratitude that he’d been Patricia’s victim instead of hers.
#DEAN.
Most remarkable! And what did the young man say?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
He dazzled me with an amazing flare - up. Exhausted his vocabulary on my injustice and Clare’s perfections, and stormed out of the room, leaving me with tingling ears.
#DEAN.
And now?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Presumably he’s gone in search of this maligned young woman. My blessings attend on him!... Well, Dean, I’m a brilliant and original tactician, what?
#DEAN.
Brilliant, certainly—original, no!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No?
#DEAN.
Not ten minutes ago I adopted precisely the same tactics with Clare and achieved precisely the same result. She’s searching for your worthless son at present.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Upon my word, I should never have credited you with so much sense!
#DEAN.
My dear Eileen, I put down the tragedy of so many women’s lives——
#JOHN GALE.
Lady Patricia Cosway.
#DEAN.
Lady Patricia, this is indeed an——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No, Dean; it’s neither unexpected nor a pleasure.
#DEAN.
I must really beg of you, Eileen! Won’t you sit down?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do you refuse me your hand?...
#DEAN.
My dear lady!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ah.... You were always large - minded and gentle and tolerant.... Aunt Eileen....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Well?
#LADY PATRICIA.
They told me you were here, so I came out. I am determined to speak before you both. It was not what I had meant to do. I had hoped to lay bare my secret soul in secret to the Dean. Deliberately I have chosen the fiercer ordeal. For I expect and deserve no sympathy from you, no mercy, no forgiveness, no understanding....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I think I understand you well enough, Patricia.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But do you? Oh, do you? Can any one so sane and practical understand this living paradox? Can prose ever understand poetry? I am the refined essence of spirit and sense. I am a thing of fire and dew. I have in me the making of a great saint and a great courtesan....
#DEAN.
Yes, yes; we quite understand....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Go ahead, Patricia.
#LADY PATRICIA.
If you really understand, my task will be so much the easier! For understanding is the beginning of sympathy. And sympathy ends in forgiveness.... Dean, Aunt Eileen—will you be patient and listen to me for a moment?
#DEAN.
Of course we will. But won’t you sit down?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I should prefer to stand.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
It’s more effective, Dean.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What you overheard yesterday gave you only a crude outline of my tragedy and sin. All the colour, all the light and shadow were missing; and without these you are bound to misjudge me.... Ah! don’t believe for a moment I am seeking to justify myself! No! No! There can be no real justification for my sin.... But I do want your understanding—I do want your pity—I do want your pardon. And from you, Dean, I have come for punishment—for penance——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Hand her over to Baldwin.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Baldwin?
#DEAN.
Eileen! I beg of you!
#LADY PATRICIA.
On the surface my marriage has been perfect. Michael is the husband of old romance, steel - true, chivalrous, and devoted—oh! as no man was ever devoted to a woman before! But he just lacked what the depths of my complex nature cried out for—passion, simplicity, primeval energy. These he hadn’t in him to give, and I wanted them, not knowing at first what I wanted.... But when Bill came into my life—I knew—I knew ... and we rushed together, drawn by the mystic gravitation of alien soul for soul.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
moment, Patricia. I understand that my son has “primeval energy.” I’ve never noticed it myself. What are its manifestations?
#DEAN.
Don’t you think we can leave that to—er—the imagination?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh ... by all means! Then what do you mean by “rushing together”?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I use the expression metaphorically ... spiritually. Dean—Aunt Eileen—I swear to you by all that is beautiful and sacred that our love has been pure. You believe me? Ah, say you believe me!
#DEAN.
Why, of course we do!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
If you swore to the contrary, I should call you a liar! You’ve neither the strength nor the courage to do more than play with sin. I! Oh, how little you know me! Had you looked into my heart when first this temptation stole upon me you would have never said anything so foolish.... Shall I ever forget those long nights of battle when my skin was dry and fevered—my pillow wet with tears? I lived with clenched hands and bitten lip, and fixed my thoughts steadfastly on high and holy things. Yes, I fought the good fight well—and if I was half defeated ... I am but human.... At last it came—the day came when I lost the battle.... Spring was in the air, sweet perfumes of budding and burgeoning things ... above my head a blackbird fluted ... I had an early snowdrop in my hand. He looked at me; I felt his eyes devouring my face. Slowly I lifted mine—our eyes met—and no force on earth could have torn them apart; and the world reeled and sang about us—— Oh, and that bluer blue, that greener green!...
#MRS. O’FARREL.
That bluer blue—that——?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Stephen Phillips.... Ah, that moment! I was mad—I was drunk with love and spring!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Fate intervened and saved us.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fate?
#DEAN.
Fate?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Baldwin returned with the water.
#DEAN AND MRS. O’FARREL.
The water?
#LADY PATRICIA.
For the snowdrop.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Doesn’t it occur to you that was rather funny?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Funny? No, oh no! I see a certain ironical humour in such banal intervention. But it’s far too mysterious to be called funny. After that I struggled no more against the stream. I drifted; I was carried down the great ocean of love. But I never once faltered in my high resolve to keep that ocean pure, and——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Ocean? What ocean?
#LADY PATRICIA.
The ocean of love.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Sorry; my fault.
#LADY PATRICIA.
To keep that ocean pure, and come what might, to shield Michael from the least suspicion that his wonderful love was not returned. Deceit? Oh, yes! But surely, surely deceit is justified when the alternative means—death!
#DEAN.
Death! Dear me!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Do you really think poor Michael would succumb if he learned the dreadful truth?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I know it. Have you ever seen such devotion as his?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
It’s certainly remarkable....
#DEAN.
Now, Lady Patricia, are you prepared to put yourself unreservedly in my hands?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I am.
#DEAN.
Then I shall require two things of you. Firstly, that you break off these relations with young O’Farrel.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I have determined on that already. I won’t speak of the suffering it will cause me. I have merited suffering and will bear it in silence. But when I think of him——! My poor, poor boy! What is to become of him without me?... Oh, you are his mother—can you devise no means of softening this blow for him?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I think we may safely leave that in the hands of Providence.
#DEAN.
I quite share your opinion. Secondly, Lady Patricia, I wish you to tell your husband everything.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#DEAN.
Everything.
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no. It’s impossible. I could never think of doing that.
#DEAN.
You said just now you would place yourself unreservedly in my hands.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But I never dreamt you intended to punish the innocent for my sin. Why should Michael’s life and happiness be blighted because I’ve strayed from righteousness?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I think it’s just possible Michael may survive the shock.
#LADY PATRICIA.
And I know that it will kill him. It’s impossible!
#DEAN.
I insist.
#LADY PATRICIA.
And I refuse.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
That brings me into the fray! The Dean, as your confessor, no doubt considers himself bound to keep your story secret. I don’t. So look here, Patricia; unless you make a clean breast of this to Michael, I shall go to him with it myself.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I. LADY PATRICIA. No! No! I don’t believe you’re capable of such infamy.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Oh, yes I am.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I don’t believe it. I don’t believe it! It would be too cruel and wicked! Aunt Eileen, for pity’s sake——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
You won’t get any pity out of me, my dear—not an ounce! Either you or I tell Michael the story from start to finish—and if I tell him, there won’t be much left of your character when I’ve finished.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What am I to do? What am I to do? Dean—Dean—will you allow my aunt to wreak her horrible vengeance on me by murdering my husband?
#DEAN.
Oh, but really, I don’t think it will be quite so bad as that.
#LADY PATRICIA.
But I know it—I know it!
#DEAN.
Besides, how am I to prevent her—even if I wished to?
#LADY PATRICIA.
As the mouthpiece of spiritual authority....
#MRS. O’FARREL.
I don’t care a rap for his spiritual authority.
#DEAN.
You see.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Then—you—really—mean—to—do—this?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Certainly.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I—am—ruined.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Nonsense! I’ve a strong idea this may be the saving of you both.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Ruined.... I should like to sit down.
#DEAN.
My dear lady——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Is that ... milk?
#DEAN.
Yes. Would you——
#LADY PATRICIA.
I should like a little milk. Thank you.... will tell Michael all.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Bravo! We shall make a woman of you yet!
#LADY PATRICIA.
You are very hard and cruel and vindictive.... But I forgive you.
#JOHN GALE.
Mr. Cosway has called, sir.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#DEAN.
Where is he?
#JOHN GALE.
In the study, sir.
#DEAN.
Lady Patricia——
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no—no.
#DEAN.
Just a minute, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What does it mean? Why is he here?
#DEAN.
He said he might call this morning on the way to church. Lady Patricia, go to him now. Tell him everything now.
#LADY PATRICIA.
I can’t—I can’t——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Get it over, Patricia.
#DEAN.
Come, dear lady——
#LADY PATRICIA.
I haven’t the strength—I haven’t the strength to go to him.... My knees tremble. Bring him here and leave us together....
#DEAN.
John.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes sir?
#DEAN.
Ask Mr. Cosway to come here.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes sir.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Cheer up, Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
A little since and I was glad, but now I never shall be glad or sad again....
#DEAN.
I—er—beg your pardon?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Swinburne.... For the last time—for the last time, Aunt Eileen, I ask you to spare me.
#DEAN.
Perhaps, after all, we had better——
#MRS. O’FARREL.
No! Don’t be a fool, Dean! No, Patricia, you’ve got to go through with this. Believe me, the result will astonish you.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What do you mean?
#DEAN.
Ah, good morning, Cosway.
#MICHAEL.
Patricia!... Have you told her?
#DEAN.
Hsh!
#MICHAEL.
Patricia, dearest.... I—I didn’t expect to find you here.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Nor—I—you....
#DEAN.
Lady Patricia wants to speak to you privately. We—er—will leave you together.
#MICHAEL.
Privately?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Good morning, Michael.
#MICHAEL.
Er—good morning.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Delightful weather!
#MICHAEL.
Yes—er—ver—very nice.
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Come along, Dean.
#DEAN.
Poor woman!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Fiddlesticks!
#MICHAEL.
You—you look so white and strange, dearest. Are you ill ... Patricia?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I am thirsty.... My throat is parched.... Please give me some milk....
#MICHAEL.
Milk?... Yes, dear. I’ll be back in a moment.
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no. It is on the table.
#MICHAEL.
The milk?... Oh, yes. I see.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Don’t kneel to me—don’t kneel to me! It is boiled....
#MICHAEL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no—no—no! Don’t look at me—don’t touch me—stand up—stand away from me....
#MICHAEL.
Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Do as I say.
#MICHAEL.
They—they have told you—they——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Hush!... don’t speak. Give me time.... I—I am a broken woman.
#MICHAEL.
No, no, no! I will cherish you—I will worship you—I will serve you on my knees——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!
#MICHAEL.
All the rest of my life—every hour—every moment—will be given to making up for my sin.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Your sin?
#MICHAEL.
My crime then.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Your——!
#MICHAEL.
It was cruel of them—it was unfair to steal a march on me like this. For your sake—for mine—they should have left the confession to me. I would have withheld nothing. I would have told you all of my own free will. But they’ve spoken. And I see it—they’ve put the vilest construction on the few words they overheard last night. They have made you believe the worst of me. But it’s not true, Patricia. I swear it. It’s not true. No, no, let me speak!... I have been faithful to the letter of our marriage vow—I have been unfaithful to the spirit. I am a man with a man’s passions, but for your sake I fought and kept my sinful love pure. Doubt all else—but believe that. You must believe it. You shall.... I am not trying to excuse myself. There is no excuse for what I have done. But O, Patricia, you know that to love and not to love isn’t in our control. And if I never loved you with all the passion I pretended ... I’m really deeply attached to you. It was for your sake I pretended. I felt it might kill you should you ever dream that your wonderful love was not returned in full ... that I loved ... elsewhere.
#LADY PATRICIA.
What are you talking about?
#MICHAEL.
Eh ...?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You appear to be under the impression that the Dean and Aunt Eileen have told me something unpleasant about you.
#MICHAEL.
Well, haven’t they?
#LADY PATRICIA.
They have told me nothing.
#MICHAEL.
Oh.... I—I thought they had....
#LADY PATRICIA.
And now perhaps you will kindly explain the meaning of all this.
#MICHAEL.
I—I’ve told you everything.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Who is the woman?
#MICHAEL.
Clare Lesley.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Clare—Lesley!... I don’t believe it—it’s impossible. I don’t believe it!... Do you mean to tell me that you don’t adore me?
#MICHAEL.
I’m—I’m very fond of you.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Fond of me? Then all your passion has been a sham, and you’ve been making love to that—that—oh, what is the horrible word?...
#MICHAEL.
Er—impossible ...?
#LADY PATRICIA.
No—no ... with two “p’s.” ...
#MICHAEL.
Appalling ...?
#LADY PATRICIA.
No.... Flapper.... Oh, how I’ve been fooled! And they know it—the Dean and Aunt Eileen. You’ve made me a figure of fun—something to point and jeer at.... Oh, I could kill myself and—you!
#MICHAEL.
I am not worthy to live.
#LADY PATRICIA.
And to think of all I have gone through for your sake—how I’ve forced myself to take your kisses and return them—how for months and months I fought and struggled to keep down the one great passion of my life. All for your sake—all because I thought you loved me! Oh, the bitter irony of it!
#MICHAEL.
What do you mean by this?
#LADY PATRICIA.
But now the one obstacle to my love has been removed. I will go to him now—I will put my arms around him. He shall love me and I will love him.
#MICHAEL.
What are you saying, Patricia? Are you mad? Of whom are you speaking?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill. Bill O’Farrel—Bill, whom I love and who loves me.
#MICHAEL.
Bill O’Farrel!
#LADY PATRICIA.
For two years he has been the passion of my soul. He will now become my heart’s delight. Yes, Michael, you have taken my wonderful and unrequited love for you too much for granted. You have played the infatuated husband so artistically that I believed in it to the extent of playing the infatuated wife in return.
#MICHAEL.
You!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes, I! I remained with you—I pretended to be absorbed in you, because I thought it would kill you if you realised that I wanted something more than you.
#MICHAEL.
Bill O’Farrel....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes—Bill O’Farrel!
#MICHAEL.
Does any one know of this?
#LADY PATRICIA.
They all know.
#MICHAEL.
That you’ve tricked and fooled me and made a laughing - stock of me? Oh——
#LADY PATRICIA.
What have you done with me?
#MICHAEL.
When did they find it out?
#LADY PATRICIA.
They overheard us last night.
#MICHAEL.
You and O’Farrel?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes.
#MICHAEL.
In the tree—when they overheard us?
#LADY PATRICIA.
You, too! Ah, I see it all now—I see it all. She said I must confess to you—that aunt—she said the result would astonish me. And now—now she’s hugging herself with vindictive joy at having humiliated me to the dust. But she has not finished with me yet. No! I can still strike back—and strike I will! You have no love for me. Very well. I know where to go for love.
#MICHAEL.
What do you mean?
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill loves me—he loves me—he worships me. I shall go to him—I shall hold him to me—I shall love him.
#MICHAEL.
I forbid it.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Who are you to forbid me?
#MICHAEL.
I am your husband.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You! You are no husband of mine! He is my husband because he loves me!
#MICHAEL.
If you go to him, I will return to Clare.
#LADY PATRICIA.
To Clare!
#MICHAEL.
To the girl who loves me with all the strength of her young heart and soul.
#LADY PATRICIA.
You shall never do that!
#MICHAEL.
And who’s to prevent me?
#LADY PATRICIA.
I. MICHAEL. You—the woman who has tricked me—fooled me, and now threatens to leave me for another!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Threatens! I don’t threaten. I mean to do it.
#MICHAEL.
Very well, then. Leave me to go my own way.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Go to her. Go to her. And I will go to him.
#MICHAEL.
Clare!...
#LADY PATRICIA.
Bill!
#BILL.
Er—good morning, Cousin Patricia.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Good morning, Bill.
#CLARE.
Good morning, Mr. Cosway.
#MICHAEL.
Good morning, Clare.
#BILL.
I say—you tell them.
#CLARE.
No—you.
#BILL.
Awfully—er—jolly morning, Cousin Patricia, isn’t it.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Yes ... very ... jolly.
#CLARE.
I’ve been for—for a walk, Mr. Cosway.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, yes—it’s nice weather for walking. Are you tired?
#CLARE.
Oh, no, thank you. Tell them....
#BILL.
I say ... I say, Michael.
#MICHAEL.
Sir?
#BILL.
You’ll be glad—I mean you’ll be awfully surprised to hear that I—that Clare and I—that’s to say, that we’re—Clare and I, you know——
#CLARE.
Oh, get it out!
#BILL.
Well, you see—we’re engaged.
#LADY PATRICIA AND MICHAEL.
Engaged!
#BILL.
Yes. We hadn’t meant to be—but ... we are.
#CLARE.
We tried awfully hard to hold out for—for the sake of others ... but—— I’m awfully sorry, Mike. I’m a beast, I know. But I can’t help it....
#MICHAEL.
How long have you loved him?
#CLARE.
Oh ... ages ... I ought to have told you, but——
#MICHAEL.
I don’t wish to hear another word.
#BILL.
I—I—I—I’m sorry—I’ve behaved rottenly—but I—I—I’m awfully fond of you.... Of course I ought—but you see—I—that’s to say—but she—she’s—you know what I mean—I’m——
#LADY PATRICIA.
Enough....
#CLARE.
Now for the pater....
#BILL.
Help!...
#BALDWIN.
’Scuse me, Mr. John, but I think as I lef’ my ’ymn - book and prayer - book on the lawn.
#JOHN GALE.
I haven’t seen ’em.
#BALDWIN.
That’s them yonder. Lord, if that ain’t the first bell! Beg pardon, m’lady. Beg pardon, sir. I jest want my prayer - book an’ ’ymn - book. Thank ’ee, m’lady. They was given me by Mrs. Baldwin as was me first wife. I thought as ’ow I’d lef’ them on ’er grave jest now when I went to ’ave a look at it. But——
#MICHAEL.
That will do, Baldwin.
#BALDWIN.
Thank ’ee, sir.
#BILL.
I say, darling, weren’t they corking?
#CLARE.
S - sh!...
#BILL.
Oh....
#DEAN.
So much for tact and diplomacy!
#MRS. O’FARREL.
And common - sense!
#DEAN.
And these two?
#MRS. O’FARREL.
Best leave them alone.
#DEAN.
No, no!... Are you not going to join us in church? My dear friends, on such a morning as this we should all sing the Te Deum, and forget everything but the joy of being alive....
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!...
#MICHAEL.
Yes.
#LADY PATRICIA.
Under the great rose window in the south transept our pew is now full of purple and amber lights and shafts of chrysoprase. Shall we not sit there again together?
#MICHAEL.
I don’t see what else there is to do.... Patricia!
#LADY PATRICIA.
Michael!... Repentance is very exquisite, and how beautiful is forgiveness. Come....
